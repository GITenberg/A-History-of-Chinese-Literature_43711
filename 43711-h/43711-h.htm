<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This is the first attempt made in any language, including
Chinese, to produce a history of Chinese literature.</p>

<p>Native scholars, with their endless critiques and
appreciations of individual works, do not seem ever to
have contemplated anything of the kind, realising, no
doubt, the utter hopelessness, from a Chinese point
of view, of achieving even comparative success in a
general historical survey of the subject. The voluminous
character of a literature which was already in
existence some six centuries before the Christian era,
and has run on uninterruptedly until the present date,
may well have given pause to writers aiming at completeness.
The foreign student, however, is on a totally
different footing. It may be said without offence that
a work which would be inadequate to the requirements
of a native public, may properly be submitted to English
readers as an introduction into the great field which
lies beyond.</p>

<p>Acting upon the suggestion of Mr. Gosse, to whom I
am otherwise indebted for many valuable hints, I have
devoted a large portion of this book to translation, thus
enabling the Chinese author, so far as translation will
allow, to speak for himself. I have also added, here and
there, remarks by native critics, that the reader may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
able to form an idea of the point of view from which the
Chinese judge their own productions.</p>

<p>It only remains to be stated that the translations,
with the exception of a few passages from Legge’s
“Chinese Classics,” in each case duly acknowledged,
are my own.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

LEGENDARY AGES&mdash;EARLY CHINESE CIVILISATION&mdash;ORIGIN
OF WRITING</h3>


<p>The date of the beginning of all things has been nicely
calculated by Chinese chronologers. There was first of
all a period when Nothing existed, though some enthusiasts
have attempted to deal with a period antecedent
even to that. Gradually Nothing took upon itself the
form and limitations of Unity, represented by a point at
the centre of a circle. Thus there was a Great Monad,
a First Cause, an Aura, a Zeitgeist, or whatever one
may please to call it.</p>

<p>After countless ages, spent apparently in doing
nothing, this Monad split into Two Principles, one
active, the other passive; one positive, the other negative;
light and darkness; male and female. The interaction
of these Two Principles resulted in the production
of all things, as we see them in the universe around us,
2,269,381 years ago. Such is the cosmogony of the
Chinese in a nutshell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The more sober Chinese historians, however, are content
to begin with a sufficiently mythical emperor, who
reigned only 2800 years before the Christian era. The
practice of agriculture, the invention of wheeled vehicles,
and the simpler arts of early civilisation are generally
referred to this period; but to the dispassionate European
student it is a period of myth and legend: in fact,
we know very little about it. Neither do we know much,
in the historical sense, of the numerous rulers whose
names and dates appear in the chronology of the succeeding
two thousand years. It is not indeed until we
reach the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> that anything like history
can be said to begin.</p>

<p>For reasons which will presently be made plain, the
sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> is a convenient starting-point for the
student of Chinese literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEUDALISM</div>

<p>China was then confined to a comparatively small
area, lying for the most part between the Yellow River
on the north and the river Yang-tsze on the south. No
one knows where the Chinese came from. Some hold
the fascinating theory that they were emigrants from
Accadia in the ancient kingdom of Babylonia; others
have identified them with the lost tribes of Israel. No
one seems to think they can possibly have originated in
the fertile plains where they are now found. It appears
indeed to be an ethnological axiom that every race must
have come from somewhere outside its own territory.
However that may be, the China of the eighth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> consisted of a number of Feudal States, ruled by
nobles owning allegiance to a Central State, at the head
of which was a king. The outward tokens of subjection
were homage and tribute; but after all, the allegiance
must have been more nominal than real, each State being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
practically an independent kingdom. This condition of
things was the cause of much mutual jealousy, and often
of bloody warfare, several of the States hating one another
quite as cordially as Athens and Sparta at their best.</p>

<p>There was, notwithstanding, considerable physical
civilisation in the ancient States of those early days.
Their citizens, when not employed in cutting each other’s
throats, enjoyed a reasonable security of life and property.
They lived in well-built houses; they dressed in
silk or homespun; they wore shoes of leather; they
carried umbrellas; they sat on chairs and used tables;
they rode in carts and chariots; they travelled by boat;
and they ate their food off plates and dishes of pottery,
coarse perhaps, yet still superior to the wooden trencher
common not so very long ago in Europe. They measured
time by the sundial, and in the Golden Age they
had the two famous calendar trees, representations of
which have come down to us in sculpture, dating from
about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 150. One of these trees put forth a leaf every
day for fifteen days, after which a leaf fell off daily for
fifteen more days. The other put forth a leaf once a
month for half a year, after which a leaf fell off monthly
for a similar period. With these trees growing in the
courtyard, it was possible to say at a glance what was
the day of the month, and what was the month of the
year. But civilisation proved unfavourable to their
growth, and the species became extinct.</p>

<p>In the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> the Chinese were also in possession
of a written language, fully adequate to the most
varied expression of human thought, and indeed almost
identical with their present script, allowing, among other
things, for certain modifications of form brought about
by the substitution of paper and a camel’s-hair brush for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the bamboo tablet and stylus of old. The actual stages
by which that point was reached are so far unknown to
us. China has her Cadmus in the person of a prehistoric
individual named Ts’ang Chieh, who is said to have had
four eyes, and to have taken the idea of a written language
from the markings of birds’ claws upon the sand.
Upon the achievement of his task the sky rained grain
and evil spirits mourned by night. Previous to this
mankind had no other system than rude methods of
knotting cords and notching sticks for noting events or
communicating with one another at a distance.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the written language of China,
invention is altogether out of the question. It seems
probable that in prehistoric ages, the Chinese, like other
peoples, began to make rude pictures of the sun, moon,
and stars, of man himself, of trees, of fire, of rain, and
they appear to have followed these up by ideograms of
various kinds. How far they went in this direction we
can only surmise. There are comparatively few obviously
pictorial characters and ideograms to be found
even in the script of two thousand years ago; but investigations
carried on for many years by Mr. L. C.
Hopkins, H.M. Consul, Chefoo, and now approaching
completion, point more and more to the fact that the
written language will some day be recognised as systematically
developed from pictorial symbols. It is, at
any rate, certain that at a very early date subsequent
to the legendary period of “knotted cords” and
“notches,” while the picture-symbols were still comparatively
few, some master-mind reached at a bound
the phonetic principle, from which point the rapid
development of a written language such as we now
find would be an easy matter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

CONFUCIUS&mdash;THE FIVE CLASSICS</h3>


<div class="sidenote">BOOK OF HISTORY</div>

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 551 <span class="smcap">Confucius</span> was born. He may be regarded
as the founder of Chinese literature. During his years
of office as a Government servant and his years of
teaching and wandering as an exile, he found time to
rescue for posterity certain valuable literary fragments
of great antiquity, and to produce at least one original
work of his own. It is impossible to assert that before
his time there was anything in the sense of what we
understand by the term general literature. The written
language appears to have been used chiefly for purposes
of administration. Many utterances, however, of early,
not to say legendary, rulers had been committed to
writing at one time or another, and such of these as
were still extant were diligently collected and edited by
Confucius, forming what is now known as the <cite>Shu Ching</cite>
or Book of History. The documents of which this work
is composed are said to have been originally one
hundred in all, and they cover a period extending
from the twenty-fourth to the eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> They
give us glimpses of an age earlier than that of Confucius,
if not actually so early as is claimed. The first two, for
instance, refer to the Emperors Yao and Shun, whose
reigns, extending from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2357 to 2205, are regarded
as the Golden Age of China. We read how the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
monarch “united the various parts of his domain in
bonds of peace, so that concord reigned among the
black-haired people.” He abdicated in favour of Shun,
who is described as being profoundly wise, intelligent,
and sincere. We are further told that Shun was chosen
because of his great filial piety, which enabled him to
live in harmony with an unprincipled father, a shifty
stepmother, and an arrogant half-brother, and, moreover,
to effect by his example a comparative reformation of
their several characters.</p>

<p>We next come to a very famous personage, who
founded the Hsia dynasty in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2205, and is known as
the Great Yü. It was he who, during the reign of the
Emperor Shun, successfully coped with a devastating
flood, which has been loosely identified with the Noachic
Deluge, and in reference to which it was said in the
<cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, “How grand was the achievement of Yü,
how far-reaching his glorious energy! But for Yü we
should all have been fishes.” The following is his own
account (Legge’s translation):&mdash;</p>

<p>“The inundating waters seemed to assail the heavens,
and in their vast extent embraced the mountains and
overtopped the hills, so that people were bewildered and
overwhelmed. I mounted my four conveyances (carts,
boats, sledges, and spiked shoes), and all along the hills
hewed down the woods, at the same time, along with
Yi, showing the multitudes how to get flesh to eat. I
opened passages for the streams throughout the nine
provinces, and conducted them to the sea. I deepened
the channels and canals, and conducted them to the
streams, at the same time, along with Chi, sowing grain,
and showing the multitudes how to procure the food
of toil in addition to flesh meat. I urged them further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to exchange what they had for what they had not, and
to dispose of their accumulated stores. In this way all
the people got grain to eat, and all the States began to
come under good rule.”</p>

<p>A small portion of the Book of History is in verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The people should be cherished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should not be downtrodden.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people are the root of a country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the root is firm, the country will be tranquil.<br /></span>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The palace a wild for lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The country a wild for hunting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich wine, seductive music,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lofty roofs, carved walls,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Given any one of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the result can only be ruin.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the date of the foundation of the Hsia dynasty
the throne of the empire was transmitted from father to
son, and there were no more abdications in favour of
virtuous sages. The fourth division of the Book of
History deals with the decadence of the Hsia rulers and
their final displacement in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1766 by T’ang the Completer,
founder of the Shang dynasty. By <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1122, the
Shang sovereigns had similarly lapsed from the kingly
qualities of their founder to even a lower level of degradation
and vice. Then arose one of the purest and most
venerated heroes of Chinese history, popularly known by
his canonisation as Wên Wang. He was hereditary ruler
of a principality in the modern province of Shensi, and in
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1144 he was denounced as dangerous to the throne.
He was seized and thrown into prison, where he passed
two years, occupying himself with the Book of Changes,
to which we shall presently return. At length the
Emperor, yielding to the entreaties of the people, backed
up by the present of a beautiful concubine and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fine horses, set him at liberty and commissioned him
to make war upon the frontier tribes. To his dying day
he never ceased to remonstrate against the cruelty and
corruption of the age, and his name is still regarded
as one of the most glorious in the annals of the empire.
It was reserved for his son, known as Wu Wang, to
overthrow the Shang dynasty and mount the throne as
first sovereign of the Chou dynasty, which was to last
for eight centuries to come. The following is a speech
by the latter before a great assembly of nobles who were
siding against the House of Shang. It is preserved
among others in the Book of History, and is assigned
to the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1133 (Legge’s translation):&mdash;</p>

<p>“Heaven and Earth are the parents of all creatures;
and of all creatures man is the most highly endowed.
The sincere, intelligent, and perspicacious among men
becomes the great sovereign, and the great sovereign
is the parent of the people. But now, Shou, the king
of Shang, does not reverence Heaven above, and inflicts
calamities on the people below. He has been abandoned
to drunkenness, and reckless in lust. He has
dared to exercise cruel oppression. Along with criminals
he has punished all their relatives. He has put men
into office on the hereditary principle. He has made
it his pursuit to have palaces, towers, pavilions, embankments,
ponds, and all other extravagances, to the
most painful injury of you, the myriad people. He has
burned and roasted the loyal and good. He has ripped
up pregnant women. Great Heaven was moved with
indignation, and charged my deceased father, Wên,
reverently to display its majesty; but he died before
the work was completed.</p>

<p>“On this account I, Fa, who am but a little child, have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by means of you, the hereditary rulers of my friendly
States, contemplated the government of Shang; but
Shou has no repentant heart. He abides squatting on
his heels, not serving God or the spirits of heaven and
earth, neglecting also the temple of his ancestors, and
not sacrificing in it. The victims and the vessels of
millet all become the prey of wicked robbers; and still
he says, ‘The people are mine: the decree is mine,’
never trying to correct his contemptuous mind. Now
Heaven, to protect the inferior people, made for them
rulers, and made for them instructors, that they might
be able to be aiding to God, and secure the tranquillity
of the four quarters of the empire. In regard to who
are criminals and who are not, how dare I give any
allowance to my own wishes?</p>

<p>“‘Where the strength is the same, measure the virtue
of the parties; where the virtue is the same, measure
their righteousness.’ Shou has hundreds of thousands
and myriads of ministers, but they have hundreds of thousands
and myriads of minds; I have three thousand ministers,
but they have one mind. The iniquity of Shang
is full. Heaven gives command to destroy it. If I did
not comply with Heaven, my iniquity would be as great.</p>

<p>“I, who am a little child, early and late am filled with
apprehensions. I have received charge from my deceased
father, Wên; I have offered special sacrifice to
God; I have performed the due services to the great
Earth; and I lead the multitude of you to execute the
punishment appointed by Heaven. Heaven compassionates
the people. What the people desire, Heaven
will be found to give effect to. Do you aid me, the one
man, to cleanse for ever all within the four seas. Now
is the time!&mdash;it may not be lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the documents which form the Book of History
are directed against luxury and drunkenness, to
both of which the people seemed likely to give way
even within measurable distance of the death of Wên
Wang. The latter had enacted that wine (that is to
say, ardent spirits distilled from rice) should only be
used on sacrificial occasions, and then under strict
supervision; and it is laid down, almost as a general
principle, that all national misfortunes, culminating in
the downfall of a dynasty, may be safely ascribed to
the abuse of wine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE ODES</div>

<p>The <cite>Shih Ching</cite>, or Book of Odes, is another work for
the preservation of which we are indebted to Confucius.
It consists of a collection of rhymed ballads in various
metres, usually four words to the line, composed between
the reign of the Great Yü and the beginning of
the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> These, which now number 305,
are popularly known as the “Three Hundred,” and are
said by some to have been selected by Confucius from
no less than 3000 pieces. They are arranged under four
heads, as follows:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Ballads commonly sung by the
people in the various feudal States and forwarded
periodically by the nobles to their suzerain, the Son of
Heaven. The ballads were then submitted to the
Imperial Musicians, who were able to judge from the
nature of such compositions what would be the manners
and customs prevailing in each State, and to advise the
suzerain accordingly as to the good or evil administration
of each of his vassal rulers. (<i>b</i>) Odes sung at
ordinary entertainments given by the suzerain. (<i>c</i>) Odes
sung on grand occasions when the feudal nobles were
gathered together. (<i>d</i>) Panegyrics and sacrificial odes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Confucius himself attached the utmost importance to
his labours in this direction. “Have you learned the
Odes?” he inquired upon one occasion of his son;
and on receiving an answer in the negative, immediately
told the youth that until he did so he would be unfit for
the society of intellectual men. Confucius may indeed
be said to have anticipated the apophthegm attributed
by Fletcher of Saltoun to a “very wise man,” namely,
that he who should be allowed to make a nation’s
“ballads need care little who made its laws.” And it
was probably this appreciation by Confucius that gave
rise to an extraordinary literary craze in reference to
these Odes. Early commentators, incapable of seeing
the simple natural beauties of the poems, which have
furnished endless household words and a large stock
of phraseology to the language of the present day, and
at the same time unable to ignore the deliberate judgment
of the Master, set to work to read into countryside
ditties deep moral and political significations.
Every single one of the immortal Three Hundred has
thus been forced to yield some hidden meaning and
point an appropriate moral. If a maiden warns her
lover not to be too rash&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“Don’t come in, sir, please!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Don’t break my willow-trees!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Not that that would very much grieve me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But alack-a-day! what would my parents say?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And love you as I may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot bear to think what that would be,”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>commentators promptly discover that the piece refers
to a feudal noble whose brother had been plotting
against him, and to the excuses of the former for not
visiting the latter with swift and exemplary punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Another independent young lady may say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If you will love me dear, my lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll pick up my skirts and cross the ford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if from your heart you turn me out ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, you’re not the only man about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You silly, silly, silliest lout!”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>still commentaries are not wanting to show that these
straightforward words express the wish of the people of
a certain small State that some great State would intervene
and put an end to an existing feud in the ruling
family. Native scholars are, of course, hide-bound in
the traditions of commentators, but European students
will do well to seek the meaning of the Odes within the
compass of the Odes themselves.</p>

<p>Possibly the very introduction of these absurdities may
have helped to preserve to our day a work which would
otherwise have been considered too trivial to merit the
attention of scholars. Chinese who are in the front rank
of scholarship know it by heart, and each separate piece
has been searchingly examined, until the force of exegesis
can no farther go. There is one famous line which
runs, according to the accepted commentary, “The
muddiness of the Ching river appears from the (clearness
of the) Wei river.” In 1790 the Emperor Ch’ien
Lung, dissatisfied with this interpretation, sent a viceroy
to examine the rivers. The latter reported that the
Ching was really clear and the Wei muddy, so that the
wording of the line must mean “The Ching river is
made muddy by the Wei river.”</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of one of the longer of
the Odes, saddled, like all the rest, with an impossible
political interpretation, of which nothing more need be
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of the Odes deal with warfare, and with the
separation of wives from their husbands; others, with
agriculture and with the chase, with marriage and feasting.
The ordinary sorrows of life are fully represented,
and to these may be added frequent complaints against
the harshness of officials, one speaker going so far as
to wish he were a tree without consciousness, without
home, and without family. The old-time theme of “eat,
drink, and be merry” is brought out as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You have coats and robes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you do not trail them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have chariots and horses,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By and by you will die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another will enjoy them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You have courtyards and halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they are not sprinkled and swept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have bells and drums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they are not struck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By and by you will die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another will possess them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“You have wine and food;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That you may enjoy yourself now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lengthen your days?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By and by you will die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another will take your place.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Odes are especially valuable for the insight they
give us into the manners, and customs, and beliefs of
the Chinese before the age of Confucius. How far back
they extend it is quite impossible to say. An eclipse
of the sun, “an event of evil omen,” is mentioned in
one of the Odes as a recent occurrence on a certain day
which works out as the 29th August, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 775; and this
eclipse has been verified for that date. The following
lines are from Legge’s rendering of this Ode:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The sun and moon announce evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not keeping to their proper paths.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All through the kingdom there is no proper government,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the good are not employed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the moon to be eclipsed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but an ordinary matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that the sun has been eclipsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How bad it is!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rainbow was regarded, not as a portent of evil,
but as an improper combination of the dual forces of
nature,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There is a rainbow in the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one dares point at it,”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and is applied figuratively to women who form improper
connections.</p>

<p>The position of women generally seems to have been
very much what it is at the present day. In an Ode
which describes the completion of a palace for one of the
ancient princes, we are conducted through the rooms,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here will he live, here will he sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here will he laugh, here will he talk,”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>until we come to the bedchamber, where he will awake,
and call upon the chief diviner to interpret his dream
of bears and serpents. The interpretation (Legge) is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sons shall be born to him:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will be put to sleep on couches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will be clothed in robes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will have sceptres to play with;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cry will be loud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will be resplendent with red knee-covers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The future princes of the land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Daughters shall be born to him:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will be put to sleep on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will be clothed with wrappers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will have tiles to play with.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will be theirs neither to do wrong nor to do good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only about the spirits and the food will they have to think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to cause no sorrow to their parents.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The distinction thus drawn is severe enough, and it
is quite unnecessary to make a comparison, as some
writers on China have done, between the tile and the
sceptre, as though the former were but a dirty potsherd,
good enough for a girl. A tile was used in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ages as a weight for the spindle, and is here used merely
to indicate the direction which a girl’s activities should
take.</p>

<p>Women are further roughly handled in an Ode which
traces the prevailing misgovernment to their interference
in affairs of State and in matters which do not lie within
their province:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A clever man builds a city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clever woman lays one low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all her qualifications, that clever woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but an ill-omened bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman with a long tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a flight of steps leading to calamity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For disorder does not come from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is brought about by women.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those who cannot be trained or taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are women and eunuchs.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>About seventy kinds of plants are mentioned in the
Odes, including the bamboo, barley, beans, convolvulus,
dodder, dolichos, hemp, indigo, liquorice, melon, millet,
peony, pepper, plantain, scallions, sorrel, sowthistle,
tribulus, and wheat; about thirty kinds of trees, including
the cedar, cherry, chestnut, date, hazel, medlar,
mulberry, oak, peach, pear, plum, and willow; about
thirty kinds of animals, including the antelope, badger,
bear, boar, elephant, fox, leopard, monkey, rat, rhinoceros,
tiger, and wolf; about thirty kinds of birds,
including the crane, eagle, egret, magpie, oriole, swallow,
and wagtail; about ten kinds of fishes, including the
barbel, bream, carp, and tench; and about twenty kinds
of insects, including the ant, cicada, glow-worm, locust,
spider, and wasp.</p>

<p>Among the musical instruments of the Odes are found
the flute, the drum, the bell, the lute, and the Pandæan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pipes; among the metals are gold and iron, with an
indirect allusion to silver and copper; and among the
arms and munitions of war are bows and arrows, spears,
swords, halberds, armour, grappling-hooks, towers on
wheels for use against besieged cities, and gags for
soldiers’ mouths, to prevent them talking in the ranks on
the occasion of night attacks.</p>

<p>The idea of a Supreme Being is brought out very fully
in the Odes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Great is God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruling in majesty.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Also,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“How mighty is God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ruler of mankind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How terrible is His majesty!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He is apparently in the form of man, for in one place we
read of His footprint. He hates the oppression of great
States, although in another passage we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Behold Almighty God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is there whom He hates?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He comforts the afflicted. He is free from error. His
“Way” is hard to follow. He is offended by sin. He
can be appeased by sacrifice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“We fill the sacrificial vessels with offerings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both the vessels of wood, and those of earthenware.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when the fragrance is borne on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God smells the savour and is pleased.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">BOOK OF CHANGES</div>

<p>The next of the pre-Confucian works, and possibly the
oldest of all, is the famous <cite>I Ching</cite>, or Book of Changes.
It is ascribed to <span class="smcap">Wên Wang</span>, the virtual founder of the
Chou dynasty, whose son, <span class="smcap">Wu Wang</span>, became the first
sovereign of a long line, extending from <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1122 to
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 249. It contains a fanciful system of philosophy,
deduced originally from Eight Diagrams consisting of
triplet combinations or arrangements of a line and a
divided line, either one or other of which is necessarily
repeated twice, and in two cases three times, in the same
combination. Thus there may be three lines ☰, or
three divided lines ☷, a divided line above or below
two lines ☱ ☴, a divided line between two lines
☲, and so on, eight in all. These so-called diagrams
are said to have been invented two thousand years and
more before Christ by the monarch Fu Hsi, who copied
them from the back of a tortoise. He subsequently
increased the above simple combinations to sixty-four
double ones, on the permutations of which are based the
philosophical speculations of the Book of Changes. Each
diagram represents some power in nature, either active
or passive, such as fire, water, thunder, earth, and so on.</p>

<p>The text consists of sixty-four short essays, enigmatically
and symbolically expressed, on important
themes, mostly of a moral, social, and political character,
and based upon the same number of lineal figures, each
made up of six lines, some of which are whole and the
others divided. The text is followed by commentaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
called the Ten Wings, probably of a later date and
commonly ascribed to Confucius, who declared that
were a hundred years added to his life he would devote
fifty of them to a study of the <cite>I Ching</cite>.</p>

<p>The following is a specimen (Legge’s translation):&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>Text.</em> ䷉ This suggests the idea of one treading
on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him.
There will be progress and success.</p>

<p>“1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject treading
his accustomed path. If he go forward, there will
be no error.</p>

<p>“2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject treading
the path that is level and easy;&mdash;a quiet and
solitary man, to whom, if he be firm and correct, there
will be good fortune.</p>

<p>“3. The third line, divided, shows a one-eyed man who
thinks he can see; a lame man who thinks he can walk
well; one who treads on the tail of a tiger and is bitten.
All this indicates ill-fortune. We have a mere bravo
acting the part of a great ruler.</p>

<p>“4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject treading
on the tail of a tiger. He becomes full of apprehensive
caution, and in the end there will be good fortune.</p>

<p>“5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the resolute tread
of its subject. Though he be firm and correct, there
will be peril.</p>

<p>“6. The sixth line, undivided, tells us to look at the
whole course that is trodden, and examine the presage
which that gives. If it be complete and without failure,
there will be great good fortune.</p>

<p>“<em>Wing.</em>&mdash;In this hexagram we have the symbol of
weakness treading on that of strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“The lower trigram indicates pleasure and satisfaction,
and responds to the upper indicating strength. Hence
it is said, ‘He treads on the tail of a tiger, which does
not bite him; there will be progress and success.’</p>

<p>“The fifth line is strong, in the centre, and in its correct
place. Its subject occupies the God-given position, and
falls into no distress or failure;&mdash;his action will be
brilliant.”</p>

<p>As may be readily inferred from the above extract,
no one really knows what is meant by the apparent
gibberish of the Book of Changes. This is freely admitted
by all learned Chinese, who nevertheless hold
tenaciously to the belief that important lessons could be
derived from its pages if we only had the wit to understand
them. Foreigners have held various theories on
the subject. Dr. Legge declared that he had found the
key, with the result already shown. The late Terrien
de la Couperie took a bolder flight, unaccompanied by
any native commentator, and discovered in this cherished
volume a vocabulary of the language of the Bák
tribes. A third writer regards it as a calendar of the
lunar year, and so forth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOOK OF RITES</div>

<p>The <cite>Li Chi</cite>, or Book of Rites, seems to have been a
compilation by two cousins, known as the Elder and
the Younger <span class="smcap">Tai</span>, who flourished in the 2nd and 1st
centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> From existing documents, said to have
emanated from Confucius and his disciples, the Elder
Tai prepared a work in 85 sections on what may be
roughly called social rites. The Younger Tai reduced
these to 46 sections. Later scholars, such as Ma Jung
and Chêng Hsüan, left their mark upon the work, and
it was not until near the close of the 2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></span>
that finality in this direction was achieved. It then
became known as a <i>Chi</i> = Record, not as a <i>Ching</i> =
Text, the latter term being reserved by the orthodox
solely for such books as have reached us direct from
the hands of Confucius. The following is an extract
(Legge’s translation):&mdash;</p>

<p>Confucius said: “Formerly, along with Lao Tan, I
was assisting at a burial in the village of Hsiang, and
when we had got to the path the sun was eclipsed.
Lao Tan said to me, ‘Ch’iu, let the bier be stopped
on the left of the road; and then let us wail and wait
till the eclipse pass away. When it is light again we
will proceed.’ He said that this was the rule. When
we had returned and completed the burial, I said to
him, ‘In the progress of a bier there should be no returning.
When there is an eclipse of the sun, we do
not know whether it will pass away quickly or not;
would it not have been better to go on?’ Lao Tan
said, ‘When the prince of a state is going to the court
of the Son of Heaven, he travels while he can see the
sun. At sundown he halts and presents his offerings
(to the spirit of the way). When a great officer is on
a mission, he travels while he can see the sun, and at
sundown he halts. Now a bier does not set forth in
the early morning, nor does it rest anywhere at night;
but those who travel by starlight are only criminals
and those who are hastening to the funeral rites of a
parent.’”</p>

<p>Other specimens will be found in Chapters iii. and iv.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Until the time of the Ming dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1368, another
and a much older work, known as the <cite>Chou Li</cite>,
or Rites of the Chou dynasty, and dealing more with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
constitutional matters, was always coupled with the
<cite>Li Chi</cite>, and formed one of the then recognised Six
Classics. There is still a third work of the same class,
and also of considerable antiquity, called the <cite>I Li</cite>. Its
contents treat mostly of the ceremonial observances of
everyday life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SPRING AND AUTUMN</div>

<p>We now come to the last of the Five Classics as at
present constituted, the <cite>Ch’un Ch’iu</cite>, or Spring and
Autumn Annals. This is a chronological record of the
chief events in the State of Lu between the years <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
722-484, and is generally regarded as the work of
Confucius, whose native State was Lu. The entries are
of the briefest, and comprise notices of incursions,
victories, defeats, deaths, murders, treaties, and natural
phenomena.</p>

<p>The following are a few illustrative extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the 7th year of Duke Chao, in spring, the
Northern Yen State made peace with the Ch’i State.</p>

<p>“In the 3rd month the Duke visited the Ch’u State.</p>

<p>“In summer, on the <i>chia shên</i> day of the 4th month
(March 11th, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 594), the sun was eclipsed.</p>

<p>“In the 7th year of Duke Chuang (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 685), in
summer, in the 4th moon, at midnight, there was a
shower of stars like rain.”</p>

<p>The Spring and Autumn owes its name to the old
custom of prefixing to each entry the year, month, day,
and season when the event recorded took place; spring,
as a commentator explains, including summer, and
autumn winter. It was the work which Confucius
singled out as that one by which men would know and
commend him, and Mencius considered it quite as important
an achievement as the draining of the empire by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the Great Yü. The latter said, “Confucius completed
the Spring and Autumn, and rebellious ministers and
bad sons were struck with terror.” Consequently, just
as in the case of the Odes, native wits set to work to
read into the bald text all manner of hidden meanings,
each entry being supposed to contain approval or condemnation,
their efforts resulting in what is now known
as the praise-and-blame theory. The critics of the Han
dynasty even went so far as to declare the very title
elliptical for “praise life-giving like spring, and blame
life-withering like autumn.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TSO CHUAN</div>

<p>Such is the <cite>Ch’un Ch’iu</cite>; and if that were all, it is
difficult to say how the boast of Confucius could
ever have been fulfilled. But it is not all; there is a
saving clause. For bound up, so to speak, with the
Spring and Autumn, and forming as it were an integral
part of the work, is a commentary known as the <cite>Tso
Chuan</cite> or <span class="smcap">Tso’s</span> Commentary. Of the writer himself,
who has been canonised as the Father of Prose, and
to whose pen has also been attributed the <cite>Kuo Yü</cite> or
Episodes of the States, next to nothing is known, except
that he was a disciple of Confucius; but his glowing
narrative remains, and is likely to continue to remain,
one of the most precious heirlooms of the Chinese
people.</p>

<p>What Tso did was this. He took the dry bones of
these annals and clothed them with life and reality by
adding a more or less complete setting to each of the
events recorded. He describes the loves and hates of
the heroes, their battles, their treaties, their feastings,
and their deaths, in a style which is always effective,
and often approaches to grandeur. Circumstances of
apparently the most trivial character are expanded into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
interesting episodes, and every now and again some
quaint conceit or scrap of proverbial literature is thrown
in to give a passing flavour of its own. Under the 21st
year of Duke Hsi, the Spring and Autumn has the
following exiguous entry:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In summer there was great drought.”</p>

<p>To this the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite> adds&mdash;</p>

<p>“In consequence of the drought the Duke wished to
burn a witch. One of his officers, however, said to him,
‘That will not affect the drought. Rather repair your
city walls and ramparts; eat less, and curtail your expenditure;
practise strict economy, and urge the people
to help one another. That is the essential; what have
witches to do in the matter? If God wishes her to be
slain, it would have been better not to allow her to be
born. If she can cause a drought, burning her will only
make things worse.’ The Duke took this advice, and
during that year, although there was famine, it was not
very severe.”</p>

<p>Under the 12th year of Duke Hsüan the Spring and
Autumn says&mdash;</p>

<p>“In spring the ruler of the Ch’u State besieged the
capital of the Chêng State.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite> adds a long account of the
whole business, from which the following typical paragraph
is extracted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the rout which followed, a war-chariot of the Chin
State stuck in a deep rut and could not get on. Thereupon
a man of the Ch’u State advised the charioteer to
take out the stand for arms. This eased it a little, but
again the horses turned round. The man then advised
that the flagstaff should be taken out and used as a lever,
and at last the chariot was extricated. ‘Ah,’ said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
charioteer to the man of Ch’u, ‘we don’t know so much
about running away as the people of your worthy
State.’”</p>

<p>The <cite>Tso Chuan</cite> contains several interesting passages
on music, which was regarded by Confucius as an important
factor in the art of government, recalling the
well-known views of Plato in Book III. of his <cite>Republic</cite>.
Apropos of disease, we read that “the ancient rulers
regulated all things by music.” Also that “the superior
man will not listen to lascivious or seductive airs;” “he
addresses himself to his lute in order to regulate his
conduct, and not to delight his heart.”</p>

<p>When the rabid old anti-foreign tutor of the late
Emperor T’ung Chih was denouncing the barbarians,
and expressing a kindly desire to “sleep on their skins,”
he was quoting the phraseology of the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>.</p>

<p>One hero, on going into battle, told his friends that he
should only hear the drum beating the signal to advance,
for he would take good care not to hear the gong sounding
the retreat. Another made each of his men carry
into battle a long rope, seeing that the enemy all wore
their hair short. In a third case, where some men in
possession of boats were trying to prevent others from
scrambling in, we are told that the fingers of the assailants
were chopped off in such large numbers that they
could be picked up in double handfuls.</p>

<p>Many maxims, practical and unpractical, are to be
found scattered over the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, such as, “One day’s
leniency to an enemy entails trouble for many generations;”
“Propriety forbids that a man should profit
himself at the expense of another;” “The receiver is
as bad as the thief;” “It is better to attack than to be
attacked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>When the French fleet returned to Shanghai in 1885
after being repulsed in a shore attack at Tamsui, a local
wit at once adapted a verse of doggerel found in the
<cite>Tso Chuan</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“See goggle-eyes and greedy-guts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has left his shield among the ruts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back from the field, back from the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s brought his beard, but not his shield;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and for days every Chinaman was muttering the refrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Yü sai, yü sai<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ch’i chia fu lai.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">KU-LIANG AND KUNG-YANG</div>

<p>There are two other commentaries on the Spring and
Autumn, similar, but generally regarded as inferior,
to the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>. They are by <span class="smcap">Ku-liang</span> and <span class="smcap">Kung-yang</span>,
both of the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The following are
specimens (Legge’s translation, omitting unimportant
details):&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Text.</em>&mdash;“In spring, in the king’s first month, the first
day of the moon, there fell stones in Sung&mdash;five of them.
In the same month, six fish-hawks flew backwards, past
the capital of Sung.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The commentary of Ku-liang
says, “Why does the text first
say “there fell,” and then
“stones”? There was the falling,
and then the stones.</p>

<p>In “six fish-hawks flying
backwards past the capital of
Sung,” the number is put first,
indicating that the birds were
collected together. The language
has respect to the seeing
of the eyes.</p>

<p>The Master said, “Stones are
things without any intelligence,
and fish-hawks creatures that
have a little intelligence. The
stones, having no intelligence, are
mentioned along with the day
when they fell, and the fish-hawks,
having a little intelligence,
are mentioned along with
the month when they appeared.
The superior man (Confucius)
even in regard to such things and
creatures records nothing rashly.
His expressions about stones and
fish-hawks being thus exact, how
much more will they be so about
men!”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The commentary of Kung-yang
says, “How is it that the
text first says “there fell,” and
then “stones”?</p>

<p>“There fell stones” is a record
of what was heard. There was
heard a noise of something falling.
On looking at what had
fallen, it was seen to be stones,
On examination it was found
there were five of them.</p>

<p>Why does the text say “six,”
and then “fish-hawks”?</p>

<p>“Six fish-hawks backwards
flew” is a record of what was
seen. When they looked at the
objects, there were six. When
they examined them, they were
fish-hawks. When they examined
them leisurely, they were
flying backwards.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes these commentaries are seriously at variance
with that of Tso. For instance, the text says that
in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 689 the ruler of the Chi State “made a great
end of his State.” Tso’s commentary explains the words
to mean that for various urgent reasons the ruler abdicated.
Kung-yang, however, takes quite a different view.
He explains the passage in the sense that the State in
question was utterly destroyed, the population being
wiped out by the ruler of another State in revenge for the
death in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 893 of an ancestor, who was boiled to death
at the feudal metropolis in consequence of slander by a
contemporary ruler of the Chi State. It is important for
candidates at the public examinations to be familiar with
these discrepancies, as they are frequently called upon
to “discuss” such points, always with the object of establishing
the orthodox and accepted interpretations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KUNG-YANG CHUAN</div>

<p>The following episode is from Kung-yang’s commentary,
and is quite different from the story told by Tso in
reference to the same passage:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Text.</em>&mdash;“In summer, in the 5th month, the Sung State
made peace with the Ch’u State.</p>

<p>“In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 587 King Chuang of Ch’u was besieging the
capital of Sung. He had only rations for seven days,
and if these were exhausted before he could take the
city, he meant to withdraw. He therefore sent his
general to climb the ramparts and spy out the condition
of the besieged. It chanced that at the same time an
officer of the Sung army came forth upon the ramparts,
and the two met. ‘How is your State getting on?’
inquired the general. ‘Oh, badly,’ replied the officer.
‘We are reduced to exchanging children for food, and
their bones are chopped up for fuel.’ ‘That is bad
indeed,’ said the general; ‘I had heard, however, that
the besieged, while feeding their horses with bits
in their mouths, kept some fat ones for exhibition to
strangers. What a spirit is yours!’ To this the officer
replied, ‘I too have heard that the superior man, seeing
another’s misfortune, is filled with pity, while the ignoble
man is filled with joy. And in you I recognise the
superior man; so I have told you our story.’ ‘Be of
good cheer,’ said the general. ‘We too have only seven
days’ rations, and if we do not conquer you in that time,
we shall withdraw.’ He then bowed, and retired to
report to his master. The latter said, ‘We must now
capture the city before we withdraw.’ ‘Not so,’ replied
the general; ‘I told the officer we had only rations for
seven days.’ King Chuang was greatly enraged at this;
but the general said, ‘If a small State like Sung has
officers who speak the truth, should not the State of
Ch’u have such men also?’ The king still wished to
remain, but the general threatened to leave him, and
thus peace was brought about between the two States.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

THE FOUR BOOKS&mdash;MENCIUS</h3>


<div class="sidenote">THE LUN YÜ</div>

<p>No Chinaman thinks of entering upon a study of the
Five Classics until he has mastered and committed to
memory a shorter and simpler course known as The
Four Books.</p>

<p>The first of these, as generally arranged for students,
is the <cite>Lun Yü</cite> or Analects, a work in twenty short
chapters or books, retailing the views of Confucius on
a variety of subjects, and expressed so far as possible in
the very words of the Master. It tells us nearly all we
really know about the Sage, and may possibly have been
put together within a hundred years of his death. From
its pages we seem to gather some idea, a mere <i>silhouette</i>
perhaps, of the great moralist whose mission on earth
was to teach duty towards one’s neighbour to his fellow-men,
and who formulated the Golden Rule: “What you
would not others should do unto you, do not unto them!”</p>

<p>It has been urged by many, who should know better,
that the negative form of this maxim is unfit to rank
with the positive form as given to us by Christ. But of
course the two are logically identical, as may be shown
by the simple insertion of the word “abstain;” that is,
you would not that others should abstain from certain
actions in regard to yourself, which practically conveys
the positive injunction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>When a disciple asked Confucius to explain charity of
heart, he replied simply, “Love one another.” When,
however, he was asked concerning the principle that
good should be returned for evil, as already enunciated
by Lao Tzŭ (see ch. iv.), he replied, “What then will you
return for good? No: return good for good; for evil,
justice.”</p>

<p>He was never tired of emphasising the beauty and
necessity of truth: “A man without truthfulness! I
know not how that can be.”</p>

<p>“Let loyalty and truth be paramount with you.”</p>

<p>“In mourning, it is better to be sincere than punctilious.”</p>

<p>“Man is born to be upright. If he be not so, and
yet live, he is lucky to have escaped.”</p>

<p>“Riches and honours are what men desire; yet except
in accordance with right these may not be enjoyed.”</p>

<p>Confucius undoubtedly believed in a Power, unseen
and eternal, whom he vaguely addressed as Heaven:
“He who has offended against Heaven has none to
whom he can pray.” “I do not murmur against Heaven,”
and so on. His greatest commentator, however,
Chu Hsi, has explained that by “Heaven” is meant
“Abstract Right,” and that interpretation is accepted by
Confucianists at the present day. At the same time,
Confucius strongly objected to discuss the supernatural,
and suggested that our duties are towards the living
rather than towards the dead.</p>

<p>He laid the greatest stress upon filial piety, and taught
that man is absolutely pure at birth, and afterwards
becomes depraved only because of his environment.</p>

<p>Chapter x. of the <cite>Lun Yü</cite> gives some singular details
of the every-day life and habits of the Sage, calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to provoke a smile among those with whom reverence
for Confucius has not been a first principle from the
cradle upwards, but received with loving gravity by the
Chinese people at large. The following are extracts
(Legge’s translation) from this famous chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere,
and as if he were not able to speak. When he was in
the prince’s ancestral temple or in the court, he spoke
minutely on every point, but cautiously.</p>

<p>“When he entered the palace gate, he seemed to bend
his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.</p>

<p>“He ascended the daïs, holding up his robe with both
his hands and his body bent; holding in his breath also,
as if he dared not breathe.</p>

<p>“When he was carrying the sceptre of his prince, he
seemed to bend his body as if he were not able to bear
its weight.</p>

<p>“He did not use a deep purple or a puce colour in
the ornaments of his dress. Even in his undress he did
not wear anything of a red or reddish colour.</p>

<p>“He required his sleeping dress to be half as long
again as his body.</p>

<p>“He did not eat rice which had been injured by heat
or damp and turned sour, nor fish or flesh which was
gone. He did not eat what was discoloured, or what
was of a bad flavour, nor anything which was not in
season. He did not eat meat which was not cut properly,
nor what was served without its proper sauce.</p>

<p>“He was never without ginger when he ate. He did
not eat much.</p>

<p>“When eating, he did not converse. When in bed,
he did not speak.</p>

<p>“Although his food might be coarse rice and vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
soup, he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a grave
respectful air.</p>

<p>“If his mat was not straight, he did not sit on it.</p>

<p>“The stable being burned down when he was at
Court, on his return he said, ‘Has any man been hurt?’
He did not ask about the horses.</p>

<p>“When a friend sent him a present, though it might
be a carriage and horses, he did not bow. The only present
for which he bowed was that of the flesh of sacrifice.</p>

<p>“In bed, he did not lie like a corpse. At home, he
did not put on any formal deportment.</p>

<p>“When he saw any one in a mourning dress, though
it might be an acquaintance, he would change countenance;
when he saw any one wearing the cap of full
dress, or a blind person, though he might be in his
undress, he would salute them in a ceremonious manner.</p>

<p>“When he was at an entertainment where there was an
abundance of provisions set before him, he would change
countenance and rise up. On a sudden clap of thunder
or a violent wind, he would change countenance.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MENCIUS</div>

<p>Next in educational order follows the work briefly
known as <span class="smcap">Mencius</span>. This consists of seven books recording
the sayings and doings of a man to whose
genius and devotion may be traced the final triumph of
Confucianism. Born in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 372, a little over a hundred
years after the death of the Master, Mencius was brought
up under the care of his widowed mother, whose name is
a household word even at the present day. As a child
he lived with her at first near a cemetery, the result
being that he began to reproduce in play the solemn
scenes which were constantly enacted before his eyes.
His mother accordingly removed to another house near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the market-place, and before long the little boy forgot
all about funerals and played at buying and selling
goods. Once more his mother disapproved, and once
more she changed her dwelling; this time to a house
near a college, where he soon began to imitate the
ceremonial observances in which the students were instructed,
to the great joy and satisfaction of his mother.</p>

<p>Later on he studied under K’ung Chi, the grandson of
Confucius; and after having attained to a perfect apprehension
of the roms or Way of Confucius, became, at the
age of about forty-five, Minister under Prince Hsüan of
the Ch’i State. But the latter would not carry out his
principles, and Mencius threw up his post. Thence he
wandered away to several States, advising their rulers to
the best of his ability, but making no very prolonged stay.
He then visited Prince Hui of the Liang State, and abode
there until the monarch’s death in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 319. After that
event he returned to the State of Ch’i and resumed his
old position. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 311 he once more felt himself
constrained to resign office, and retired finally into
private life, occupying himself during the remainder of
his days in teaching and in preparing the philosophical
record which now passes under his name. He lived at
a time when the feudal princes were squabbling over
the rival systems of federation and imperialism, and he
vainly tried to put into practice at an epoch of blood
and iron the gentle virtues of the Golden Age. His
criterion was that of Confucius, but his teachings were
on a lower plane, dealing rather with man’s well-being
from the point of view of political economy. He was
therefore justly named by Chao Ch’i the Second Holy
One or Prophet, a title under which he is still known.
He was an uncompromising defender of the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Confucius, and he is considered to have effectually
“snuffed out” the heterodox schools of Yang Chu and
Mo Ti.</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of the logomachy of the
day, in which Mencius is supposed to have excelled.
The subject is a favourite one&mdash;human nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Human nature may be compared
with a block of wood; duty towards one’s neighbour,
with a wooden bowl. To develop charity and duty
towards one’s neighbour out of human nature is like
making a bowl out of a block of wood.’</p>

<p>“To this Mencius replied, ‘Can you, without interfering
with the natural constitution of the wood, make out of
it a bowl? Surely you must do violence to that constitution
in the process of making your bowl. And by
parity of reasoning you would do violence to human
nature in the process of developing charity and duty
towards one’s neighbour. From which it follows that
all men would come to regard these rather as evils than
otherwise.’</p>

<p>“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Human nature is like rushing water,
which flows east or west according as an outlet is made
for it. For human nature makes indifferently for good
or for evil, precisely as water makes indifferently for the
east or for the west.’</p>

<p>“Mencius replied, ‘Water will indeed flow indifferently
towards the east or west; but will it flow indifferently
up or down? It will not; and the tendency of human
nature towards good is like the tendency of water to flow
down. Every man has this bias towards good, just as
all water flows naturally downwards. By splashing
water, you may indeed cause it to fly over your head;
and by turning its course you may keep it for use on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the hillside; but you would hardly speak of such results
as the nature of water. They are the results, of course,
of a <i>force majeure</i>. And so it is when the nature of man
is diverted towards evil.’</p>

<p>“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘That which comes with life is nature.’</p>

<p>“Mencius replied, ‘Do you mean that there is such a
thing as nature in the abstract, just as there is whiteness
in the abstract?’</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ answered Kao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>“‘Just, for instance,’ continued Mencius, ‘as the whiteness
of a feather is the same as the whiteness of snow,
or the whiteness of snow as the whiteness of jade?’</p>

<p>“‘I do,’ answered Kao Tzŭ again.</p>

<p>“‘In that case,’ retorted Mencius, ‘the nature of a dog
is the same as that of an ox, and the nature of an ox the
same as that of a man.’</p>

<p>“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘Eating and reproduction of the species
are natural instincts. Charity is subjective and innate;
duty towards one’s neighbour is objective and acquired.
For instance, there is a man who is my senior, and I
defer to him as such. Not because any abstract principle
of seniority exists subjectively in me, but in the same
way that if I see an albino, I recognise him as a white
man because he is so objectively to me. Consequently,
I say that duty towards one’s neighbour is objective or
acquired.’</p>

<p>“Mencius replied, ‘The cases are not analogous. The
whiteness of a white horse is undoubtedly the same as
the whiteness of a white man; but the seniority of a
horse is not the same as the seniority of a man. Does
our duty to our senior begin and end with the fact of
his seniority? Or does it not rather consist in the
necessity of deferring to him as such?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kao Tzŭ said, ‘I love my own brother, but I do not
love another man’s brother. The distinction arises from
within myself; therefore I call it subjective or innate.
But I defer to a stranger who is my senior, just as I
defer to a senior among my own people. The distinction
comes to me from without; therefore I call it objective
or acquired.”</p>

<p>“Mencius retorted, ‘We enjoy food cooked by
strangers just as much as food cooked by our own
people. Yet extension of your principle lands us in the
conclusion that our appreciation of cooked food is also
objective and acquired.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is a well-known colloquy between
Mencius and a sophist of the day who tried to entangle
the former in his talk:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sophist inquired, saying, “‘Is it a rule of social
etiquette that when men and women pass things from
one to another they shall not allow their hands to
touch?’</p>

<p>“‘That is the rule,’ replied Mencius.</p>

<p>“‘Now suppose,’ continued the sophist, ‘that a man’s
sister-in-law were drowning, could he take hold of her
hand and save her?’</p>

<p>“‘Any one who did not do so,’ said Mencius, ‘would
have the heart of a wolf. That men and women when
passing things from one to another may not let their
hands touch is a rule for general application. To save
a drowning sister-in-law by taking hold of her hand is
altogether an exceptional case.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The works of Mencius abound, like the Confucian
Analects, in sententious utterances. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
examples illustrate his general bias in politics:&mdash;“The
people are of the highest importance; the gods come
second; the sovereign is of lesser weight.”</p>

<p>“Chieh and Chou lost the empire because they lost
the people, which means that they lost the confidence of
the people. The way to gain the people is to gain their
confidence, and the way to do that is to provide them
with what they like and not with what they loathe.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is how Mencius snuffed out the two heterodox
philosophers mentioned above:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The systems of Yang Chu and Mo Ti fill the whole
empire. If a man is not a disciple of the former, he is a
disciple of the latter. But Yang Chu’s egoism excludes
the claim of a sovereign, while Mo Ti’s universal altruism
leaves out the claim of a father. And he who recognises
the claim of neither sovereign nor father is a brute
beast.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yang Chu seems to have carried his egoism so far that
even to benefit the whole world he would not have
parted with a single hair from his body.</p>

<p>“The men of old knew that with life they had come
but for a while, and that with death they would shortly
depart again. Therefore they followed the desires of
their own hearts, and did not deny themselves pleasures
to which they felt naturally inclined. Fame tempted
them not; but led by their instincts alone, they took
such enjoyments as lay in their path, not seeking for a
name beyond the grave. They were thus out of the
reach of censure; while as for precedence among men,
or length or shortness of life, these gave them no
concern whatever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Mo Ti, on the other hand, showed that under the
altruistic system all calamities which men bring upon
one another would altogether disappear, and that the
peace and happiness of the Golden Age would be
renewed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TA HSÜEH AND CHUNG YUNG</div>

<p>In the <cite>Ta Hsüeh</cite>, or Great Learning, which forms
Sect. xxxix. of the Book of Rites, and really means
learning for adults, we have a short politico-ethical
treatise, the authorship of which is unknown, but is
usually attributed partly to Confucius, and partly to
<span class="smcap">Tsêng Ts’an</span>, one of the most famous of his disciples.
In the former portion there occurs the following well-known
climax:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The men of old, in their desire to manifest great
virtue throughout the empire, began with good government
in the various States. To achieve this, it was
necessary first to order aright their own families, which
in turn was preceded by cultivation of their own selves,
and that again by rectification of the heart, following
upon sincerity of purpose which comes from extension
of knowledge, this last being derived from due investigation
of objective existences.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more short treatise, known as the <cite>Chung Yung</cite>,
which forms Ch. xxviii. of the Book of Rites, brings us
to the end of the Four Books. Its title has been translated
in various ways.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Julien rendered the term by
“L’Invariable Milieu,” Legge by “The Doctrine of the
Mean.” Its authorship is assigned to <span class="smcap">K’ung Chi</span>, grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>son
of Confucius. He seems to have done little more
than enlarge upon certain general principles of his
grandfather in relation to the nature of man and right
conduct upon earth. He seizes the occasion to pronounce
an impassioned eulogium upon Confucius,
concluding with the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Therefore his fame overflows the Middle Kingdom,
and reaches the barbarians of north and south. Wherever
ships and waggons can go, or the strength of man
penetrate; wherever there is heaven above and earth
below; wherever the sun and moon shed their light,
or frosts and dews fall,&mdash;all who have blood and breath
honour and love him. Wherefore it may be said that
he is the peer of God.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

MISCELLANEOUS WRITERS</h3>


<p>Names of the authors who belong to this period, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 600
to <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 200, and of the works on a variety of subjects
attributed to them, would fill a long list. Many of the
latter have disappeared, and others are gross forgeries,
chiefly of the first and second centuries of our era, an
epoch which, curiously enough, is remarkable for a
similar wave of forgery on the other side of the world.
As to the authors, it will be seen later on that the
Chinese even went so far as to create some of these for
antiquity and then write up treatises to match.</p>

<p>There was <span class="smcap">Sun Tzŭ</span> of the 6th century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> He is
said to have written the <cite>Ping Fa</cite>, or Art of War, in
thirteen sections, whereby hangs a strange tale. When
he was discoursing one day with Prince Ho-lu of the
Wu State, the latter said, “I have read your book and
want to know if you could apply its principles to
women.” Sun Tzŭ replied in the affirmative, whereupon
the Prince took 180 girls out of his harem and
bade Sun Tzŭ deal with them as with troops. Accordingly
he divided them into two companies, and at the
head of each placed a favourite concubine of the Prince.
But when the drums sounded for drill to begin, all the
girls burst out laughing. Thereupon Sun Tzŭ, without
a moment’s delay, caused the two concubines in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>mand
to be beheaded. This at once restored order,
and ultimately the corps was raised to a state of great
efficiency.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the Art of War:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If soldiers are not carefully chosen and well drilled
to obey, their movements will be irregular. They will
not act in concert. They will miss success for want of
unanimity. Their retreat will be disorderly, one half
fighting while the other is running away. They will
not respond to the call of the gong and drum. One
hundred such as these will not hold their own against
ten well-drilled men.</p>

<p>“If their arms are not good, the soldiers might as
well have none. If the cuirass is not stout and close
set, the breast might as well be bare. Bows that will
not carry are no more use at long distances than swords
and spears. Bad marksmen might as well have no
arrows. Even good marksmen, unless able to make
their arrows pierce, might as well shoot with headless
shafts. These are the oversights of incompetent generals.
Five such soldiers are no match for one.”</p>

<p>It is notwithstanding very doubtful if we have any
genuine remains of either Sun Tzŭ, or of Kuan Tzŭ,
Wu Tzŭ, Wên Tzŭ, and several other early writers on
war, political philosophy, and cognate subjects. The
same remark applies equally to Chinese medical literature,
the bulk of which is enormous, some of it nominally
dating back to legendary times, but always failing
to stand the application of the simplest test.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Erh Ya</cite>, or Nearing the Standard, is a work
which has often been assigned to the 12th century
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> It is a guide to the correct use of many miscel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>laneous
terms, including names of animals, birds, plants,
etc., to which are added numerous illustrations. It was
first edited with commentary by Kuo P’o, of whom we
shall read later on, and some Chinese critics would have
us believe that the illustrations we now possess were
then already in existence. But the whole question is
involved in mystery. The following will give an idea
of the text:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For metal we say <i>lou</i> (to chase); for wood <i>k’o</i> (to
carve); for bone <i>ch’ieh</i> (to cut),” etc., etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">T’AN KUNG</div>

<p>There are some interesting remains of a writer named
<span class="smcap">T’an Kung</span>, who flourished in the 4th and 3rd centuries
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and whose work has been included in the
Book of Rites. The three following extracts will give
an idea of his scope:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. “One day Yu-tzŭ and Tzŭ-yu saw a child weeping
for the loss of its parents. Thereupon the former observed,
‘I never could understand why mourners should
necessarily jump about to show their grief, and would
long ago have got rid of the custom. Now here you
have an honest expression of feeling, and that is all there
should ever be.’</p>

<p>“‘My friend,’ replied Tzŭ-yu, ‘the mourning ceremonial,
with all its material accompaniments, is at once
a check upon undue emotion and a guarantee against
any lack of proper respect. Simply to give vent to
the feelings is the way of barbarians. That is not
our way.</p>

<p>“‘Consider. A man who is pleased will show it in his
face. He will sing. He will get excited. He will dance.
So, too, a man who is vexed will look sad. He will sigh.
He will beat his breast. He will jump about. The due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
regulation of these emotions is the function of a set
ceremonial.</p>

<p>“‘Further. A man dies and becomes an object of
loathing. A dead body is shunned. Therefore, a
shroud is prepared, and other paraphernalia of burial,
in order that the survivors may cease to loathe. At
death there is a sacrifice of wine and meat; when the
funeral cortège is about to start, there is another; and
after burial there is yet another. Yet no one ever saw
the spirit of the departed come to taste of the food.</p>

<p>“‘These have been our customs from remote antiquity.
They have not been discarded, because, in consequence,
men no more shun the dead. What you may censure
in those who perform the ceremonial is no blemish in
the ceremonial itself.’”</p>

<p>2. “When Tzŭ-chü died, his wife and secretary took
counsel together as to who should be interred with him.
All was settled before the arrival of his brother, Tzŭ-hêng;
and then they informed him, saying, ‘The
deceased requires some one to attend upon him in the
nether world. We must ask you to go down with his
body into the grave.’ ‘Burial of the living with the
dead,’ replied Tzŭ-hêng, ‘is not in accordance with
established rites. Still, as you say some one is wanted
to attend upon the deceased, who better fitted than his
wife and secretary? If this contingency can be avoided
altogether, I am willing; if not, then the duty will
devolve upon you two.’ From that time forth the
custom fell into desuetude.”</p>

<p>3. “When Confucius was crossing the T’ai mountain,
he overheard a woman weeping and wailing beside a
grave. He thereupon sent one of his disciples to ask
what was the matter; and the latter addressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
woman, saying, ‘Some great sorrow must have come
upon you that you give way to grief like this?’ ‘Indeed
it is so,’ replied she. ‘My father-in-law was killed here
by a tiger; after that, my husband; and now my son
has perished by the same death.’ ‘But why, then,’ inquired
Confucius, ‘do you not go away?’ ‘The government
is not harsh,’ answered the woman. ‘There!’
cried the Master, turning to his disciples; ‘remember
that. Bad government is worse than a tiger.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HSÜN TZŬ</div>

<p>The philosopher <span class="smcap">Hsün Tzŭ</span> of the 3rd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> is
widely known for his heterodox views on the nature of
man, being directly opposed to the Confucian doctrine
so warmly advocated by Mencius. The following passage,
which hardly carries conviction, contains the gist
of his argument:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By nature, man is evil. If a man is good, that is an
artificial result. For his condition being what it is, he is
influenced first of all by a desire for gain. Hence he
strives to get all he can without consideration for his
neighbour. Secondly, he is liable to envy and hate.
Hence he seeks the ruin of others, and loyalty and truth
are set aside. Thirdly, he is a slave to his animal
passions. Hence he commits excesses, and wanders
from the path of duty and right.</p>

<p>“Thus, conformity with man’s natural disposition leads
to all kinds of violence, disorder, and ultimate barbarism.
Only under the restraint of law and of lofty moral
influences does man eventually become fit to be a member
of regularly organised society.</p>

<p>“From these premisses it seems quite clear that by
nature man is evil; and that if a man is good, that is an
artificial result.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Hsiao Ching</cite>, or Classic of Filial Piety, is assigned
partly to Confucius and partly to <span class="smcap">Tsêng Ts’an</span>, though
it more probably belongs to a very much later date.
Considering that filial piety is admittedly the keystone of
Chinese civilisation, it is disappointing to find nothing
more on the subject than a poor pamphlet of commonplace
and ill-strung sentences, which gives the impression
of having been written to fill a void. One short extract
will suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Master said, ‘There are three thousand offences
against which the five punishments are directed, and
there is not one of them greater than being unfilial.</p>

<p>“‘When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the
disowning of his superiority; when the authority of
the sages is disallowed, that is the disowning of all law;
when filial piety is put aside, that is the disowning of the
principle of affection. These three things pave the way
to anarchy.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Chia Yü</cite>, or Family Sayings of Confucius, is a work
with a fascinating title, which has been ascribed by some to
the immediate disciples of Confucius, but which, as it now
exists, is usually thought by native scholars to have been
composed by Wang Su, a learned official who died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
256. There appears to have been an older work under
this same title, but how far the later work is indebted
to it, or based upon it, seems likely to remain unknown.</p>

<p>Another discredited work is the <cite>Lü Shih Ch’un Ch’iu</cite>,
or Spring and Autumn of <span class="smcap">Lü Pu-wei</span>, who died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 235
and was the putative sire of the First Emperor (see ch.
vii.). It contains a great deal about the early history of
China, some of which is no doubt based upon fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MU T’IEN TZŬ CHUAN</div>

<p>Lastly, among spurious books may be mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Mu T’ien Tzŭ Chuan</span>, an account of a mythical journey
by a sovereign of the Chou dynasty, supposed to have
been taken about 1000 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The sovereign is unfortunately
spoken of by his posthumous title, and the work
was evidently written up in the 3rd century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> to suit
a statement found in Lieh Tzŭ (see chapter vi.) to the
effect that the ruler in question did make some such
journey to the West.</p>

<h3>Chapter V<br />

POETRY&mdash;INSCRIPTIONS</h3>


<p>The poetry which is representative of the period between
the death of Confucius and the 2nd century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> is a
thing apart. There is nothing like it in the whole range
of Chinese literature. It illumines many a native pronouncement
on the poetic art, the drift of which would
otherwise remain obscure. For poetry has been defined
by the Chinese as “emotion expressed in words,” a definition
perhaps not more inadequate than Wordsworth’s
“impassioned expression.” “Poetry,” they say, “knows
no law.” And again, “The men of old reckoned it the
highest excellence in poetry that the meaning should lie
beyond the words, and that the reader should have to
think it out.” Of these three canons only the last can
be said to have survived to the present day. But in the
fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Ch’ü Yüan and his school indulged
in wild irregular metres which consorted well with their
wild irregular thoughts. Their poetry was prose run
mad. It was allusive and allegorical to a high degree,
and now, but for the commentary, much of it would be
quite unintelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LI SAO</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch’ü Yüan</span> is the type of a loyal Minister. He enjoyed
the full confidence of his Prince until at length
the jealousies and intrigues of rivals sapped his position
in the State. Then it was that he composed the <cite>Li Sao</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
or Falling into Trouble, the first section of which extends
to nearly 400 lines. Beginning from the birth
of the writer, it describes his cultivation of virtue and
his earnest endeavour to translate precept into practice.
Discouraged by failure, he visits the grave of the Emperor
Shun (chapter ii.), and gives himself up to prayer,
until at length a phœnix-car and dragons appear, and
carry him in search of his ideal away beyond the
domain of mortality,&mdash;the chariot of the Sun moving
slowly to light him longer on the way, the Moon leading
and the Winds bringing up the rear,&mdash;up to the very
palace of God. Unable to gain admission here, he
seeks out a famous magician, who counsels him to stand
firm and to continue his search; whereupon, surrounded
by gorgeous clouds and dazzling rainbows, and amid the
music of tinkling ornaments attached to his car, he starts
from the Milky Way, and passing the Western Pole,
reaches the sources of the Yellow River. Before long
he is once again in sight of his native land, but without
having discovered the object of his search.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by further disappointments, and sinking
still more deeply into disfavour, so that he cared no
longer to live, he went forth to the banks of the Mi-lo
river. There he met a fisherman who accosted him,
saying, “Are you not his Excellency the Minister?
What has brought you to this pass?” “The world,”
replied Ch’ü Yüan, “is foul, and I alone am clean.
There they are all drunk, while I alone am sober. So I
am dismissed.” “Ah!” said the fisherman, “the true
sage does not quarrel with his environment, but adapts
himself to it. If, as you say, the world is foul, why not
leap into the tide and make it clean? If all men are
drunk, why not drink with them and teach them to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
excess?” After some further colloquy, the fisherman
rowed away; and Ch’ü Yüan, clasping a large stone in
his arms, plunged into the river and was seen no more.
This took place on the fifth of the fifth moon; and ever
afterwards the people of Ch’u commemorated the day
by an annual festival, when offerings of rice in bamboo
tubes were cast into the river as a sacrifice to the spirit
of their great hero. Such is the origin of the modern
Dragon-Boat Festival, which is supposed to be a search
for the body of Ch’ü Yüan.</p>

<p>A good specimen of his style will be found in the
following short poem, entitled “The Genius of the
Mountain.” It is one of “nine songs” which, together
with a number of other pieces in a similar strain, have
been classed under the general heading, <cite>Li Sao</cite>, as above.</p>

<p>“Methinks there is a Genius of the hills, clad in
wistaria, girdled with ivy, with smiling lips, of witching
mien, riding on the red pard, wild cats galloping in the
rear, reclining in a chariot, with banners of cassia,
cloaked with the orchid, girt with azalea, culling the
perfume of sweet flowers to leave behind a memory in
the heart. But dark is the grove wherein I dwell. No
light of day reaches it ever. The path thither is dangerous
and difficult to climb. Alone I stand on the hill-top,
while the clouds float beneath my feet, and all around is
wrapped in gloom.</p>

<p>“Gently blows the east wind; softly falls the rain. In
my joy I become oblivious of home; for who in my
decline would honour me now?</p>

<p>“I pluck the larkspur on the hillside, amid the chaos
of rock and tangled vine. I hate him who has made me
an outcast, who has now no leisure to think of me.</p>

<p>“I drink from the rocky spring. I shade myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
beneath the spreading pine. Even though he were to
recall me to him, I could not fall to the level of the
world.</p>

<p>“Now booms the thunder through the drizzling rain.
The gibbons howl around me all the long night. The
gale rushes fitfully through the whispering trees. And I
am thinking of my Prince, but in vain; for I cannot lay
my grief.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUNG YÜ</div>

<p>Another leading poet of the day was <span class="smcap">Sung Yü</span>, of
whom we know little beyond the fact that he was nephew
of Ch’ü Yüan, and like his uncle both a statesman and
a poet. The following extract exhibits him in a mood
not far removed from the lamentations of the <cite>Li Sao</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Among birds the phœnix, among fishes the leviathan holds the chiefest place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleaving the crimson clouds the phœnix soars apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With only the blue sky above, far into the realms of space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the grandeur of heaven and earth is as naught to the hedge-sparrow race.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the leviathan rises in one ocean to go to rest in a second,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the depth of a puddle by a humble minnow as the depth of the sea is reckoned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And just as with birds and with fishes, so too it is with man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here soars a phœnix, there swims a leviathan ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the philosopher, full of nervous thought, with a flame that never grows dim,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>As has been stated above, the poems of this school are
irregular in metre; in fact, they are only approximately
metrical. The poet never ends his line in deference to
a prescribed number of feet, but lengthens or shortens
to suit the exigency of his thought. Similarly, he may
rhyme or he may not. The reader, however, is never
conscious of any want of art, carried away as he is by
flow of language and rapid succession of poetical imagery.</p>

<p>Several other poets, such as Chia I and Tung-fang So,
who cultivated this particular vein, but on a somewhat
lower plane, belong to the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, thus overlapping
a period which must be regarded as heralding
the birth of a new style rather than occupied with the
passing of the old.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may here be mentioned that many short pieces of
doubtful age and authorship&mdash;some few unquestionably
old&mdash;have been rescued by Chinese scholars from
various sources, and formed into convenient collections.
Of such is a verse known as “Yao’s Advice,” Yao being
the legendary monarch mentioned in chapter ii., who is
associated with Shun in China’s Golden Age:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With trembling heart and cautious steps<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Walk daily in fear of God ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you never trip over a mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You may often trip over a clod.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also the husbandman’s song, which enlarges
upon the national happiness of those halcyon days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Work, work;&mdash;from the rising sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sunset comes and the day is done<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I plough the sod<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And harrow the clod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meat and drink both come to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So what care I for the powers that be?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">INSCRIPTIONS</div>

<p>It seems to have been customary in early days to
attach inscriptions, poetical and otherwise, to all sorts of
articles for daily use. On the bath-tub of T’ang, founder
of the Shang dynasty in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1766, there was said to have
been written these words:&mdash;“If any one on any one day
can make a new man of himself, let him do so every day.”
Similarly, an old metal mirror bore as its legend, “Man
combs his hair every morning: why not his heart?”
And the following lines are said to be taken from an
ancient wash-basin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, rather than sink in the world’s foul tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would sink in the bottomless main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he who sinks in the world’s foul tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In noisome depths shall for ever abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he who sinks in the bottomless main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May hope to float to the surface again.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this class of verse, too, the metre is often irregular
and the rhyme a mere jingle, according to the canons of
the stricter prosody which came into existence later on.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />

TAOISM&mdash;THE “TAO-TÊ-CHING”</h3>


<div class="sidenote">TAO-TÊ-CHING</div>

<p>The reader is now asked to begin once more at the sixth
century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> So far we have dealt almost exclusively with
what may be called orthodox literature, that is to say, of
or belonging to or based upon the Confucian Canon. It
seemed advisable to get that well off our hands before
entering upon another branch, scarcely indeed as important,
but much more difficult to handle. This branch
consists of the literature of Taoism, or that which has
gathered around what is known as the Tao or Way of
<span class="smcap">Lao Tzŭ</span>, growing and flourishing alongside of, though
in direct antagonism to, that which is founded upon the
criteria and doctrines of Confucius. Unfortunately it is
quite impossible to explain at the outset in what this
Tao actually consists. According to Lao Tzŭ himself,
“Those who know do not tell; those who tell do not
know.” It is hoped, however, that by the time the end
of this chapter is reached, some glimmering of the meaning
of Tao may have reached the minds of those who
have been patient enough to follow the argument.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAO TZŬ</div>

<p>Lao Tzŭ was born, according to the weight of evidence,
in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 604. Omitting all reference to the supernatural
phenomena which attended his birth and early
years, it only remains to say that we really know next to
nothing about him. There is a short biography of Lao<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Tzŭ to be found in the history of Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien, to be
dealt with in Book II., chapter iii., but internal evidence
points to embroidery laid on by other hands. Just as it
was deemed necessary by pious enthusiasts to interpolate
in the work of Josephus a passage referring to Christ, so
it would appear that the original note by Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien
has been carefully touched up to suit the requirements
of an unauthenticated meeting between Lao Tzŭ and
Confucius, which has been inserted very much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos de
bottes</i>; the more so, as Confucius is made to visit Lao
Tzŭ with a view to information on Rites, a subject which
Lao Tzŭ held in very low esteem. This biography ends
with the following extraordinary episode:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lao Tzŭ abode for a long time in Chou, but when he
saw that the State showed signs of decay, he left. On
reaching the frontier, the Warden, named Yin Hsi, said
to him, ‘So you are going into retirement. I beg you to
write a book for me.’ Thereupon Lao Tzŭ wrote a book,
in two parts, on Tao and Tê,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> extending to over 5000
words. He then went away, and no one knows where
he died.”</p>

<p>It is clear from Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien’s account that he himself
had never seen the book, though a dwindling
minority still believe that we possess that book in the
well-known <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p>

<p>It must now be stated that throughout what are generally
believed to be the writings of Confucius the name
of Lao Tzŭ is never once mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is not mentioned
by Tso of the famous commentary, nor by the
editors of the Confucian Analects, nor by Tsêng Ts’an,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nor by Mencius. Chuang Tzŭ, who devoted all his
energies to the exposition and enforcement of the teaching
of Lao Tzŭ, never once drops even a hint that his
Master had written a book. In his work will now be
found an account of the meeting of Confucius and Lao
Tzŭ, but it has long since been laughed out of court as a
pious fraud by every competent Chinese critic. Chu Hsi,
Shên Jo-shui, and many others, declare emphatically
against the genuineness of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>; and scant
allusion would indeed have been made to it here, were it
not for the attention paid to it by several more or less
eminent foreign students of the language. It is interesting
as a collection of many genuine utterances of Lao
Tzŭ, sandwiched however between thick wads of padding
from which little meaning can be extracted except by
enthusiasts who curiously enough disagree absolutely
among themselves. A few examples from the real Lao
Tzŭ will now be given:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Way (Tao) which can be walked upon is not the
eternal Way.”</p>

<p>“Follow diligently the Way in your own heart, but
make no display of it to the world.”</p>

<p>“By many words wit is exhausted; it is better to preserve
a mean.”</p>

<p>“To the good I would be good. To the not-good I
would also be good, in order to make them good.”</p>

<p>“Recompense injury with kindness.”</p>

<p>“Put yourself behind, and you shall be put in front.”</p>

<p>“Abandon wisdom and discard knowledge, and the
people will be benefited an hundredfold.”</p>

<p>These last maxims are supposed to illustrate Lao Tzŭ’s
favourite doctrine of doing nothing, or, as it has been
termed, Inaction, a doctrine inseparably associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his name, and one which has ever exerted much fascination
over the more imaginative of his countrymen. It
was openly enunciated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do nothing, and all things will be done.”</p>

<p>“I do nothing, and the people become good of their
own accord.”</p>

<p>To turn to the padding, as rendered by the late Drs.
Chalmers and Legge, we may take a paragraph which
now passes as chapter vi.:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalmers</span>:&mdash;“The Spirit (like perennial spring) of the
valley never dies. This (Spirit) I call the abyss-mother.
The passage of the abyss-mother I call the root of heaven
and earth. Ceaselessly it seems to endure, and it is
employed without effort.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Legge</span>:&mdash;“The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The female mystery thus do we name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long and unbroken does its power remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Used gently, and without the touch of pain.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One more example from Chalmers’ translation will
perhaps seal the fate of this book with readers who
claim at least a minimum of sense from an old-world
classic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Where water abides, it is good for adaptability.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its heart, it is good for depth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In giving, it is good for benevolence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In speaking, it is good for fidelity.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That there was such a philosopher as Lao Tzŭ who
lived about the time indicated, and whose sayings have
come down to us first by tradition and later by written
and printed record, cannot possibly be doubted. The
great work of Chuang Tzŭ would be sufficient to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
this beyond cavil, while at the same time it forms a handy
guide to a nearer appreciation of this elusive Tao.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHUANG TZŬ</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chuang Tzŭ</span> was born in the fourth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and
held a petty official post. “He wrote,” says the historian
Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien, “with a view to asperse the Confucian
school and to glorify the mysteries of Lao Tzŭ.... His
teachings are like an overwhelming flood, which spreads
at its own sweet will. Consequently, from rulers and
ministers downwards, none could apply them to any
definite use.”</p>

<p>Here we have the key to the triumph of the Tao of
Confucius over the Tao of Lao Tzŭ. The latter was
idealistic, the former a practical system for everyday
use. And Chuang Tzŭ was unable to persuade the
calculating Chinese nation that by doing nothing,
all things would be done. But he bequeathed to
posterity a work which, by reason of its marvellous
literary beauty, has always held a foremost place. It
is also a work of much originality of thought. The
writer, it is true, appears chiefly as a disciple insisting
upon the principles of a Master. But he has contrived
to extend the field, and carry his own speculations into
regions never dreamt of by Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>The whole work of Chuang Tzŭ has not come down
to us, neither can all that now passes under his name
be regarded as genuine. Alien hands have added, vainly
indeed, many passages and several entire chapters. But
a sable robe, says the Chinese proverb, cannot be eked
out with dogs’ tails. Lin Hsi-chung, a brilliant critic
of the seventeenth century, to whose edition all students
should turn, has shown with unerring touch where the
lion left off and the jackals began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The honour of the first edition really belongs to a
volatile spirit of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, named Hsiang
Hsiu. He was probably the founder, at any rate a
member, of a small club of bibulous poets who called
themselves the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.
Death, however, interrupted his labours before he had
finished his work on Chuang Tzŭ, and the manuscript was
purloined by Kuo Hsiang, a scholar who died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 312, and
with some additions was issued by the latter as his own.</p>

<p>Before attempting to illustrate by extracts the style
and scope of Chuang Tzŭ, it will be well to collect from
his work a few passages dealing with the attributes of
Tao. In his most famous chapter, entitled Autumn
Floods, a name by which he himself is sometimes
spoken of, Chuang Tzŭ writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tao is without beginning, without end.” Elsewhere
he says, “There is nowhere where it is not.” “Tao cannot
be heard; heard, it is not Tao. Tao cannot be seen;
seen, it is not Tao. Tao cannot be spoken; spoken, it
is not Tao. That which imparts form to forms is itself
formless; therefore Tao cannot have a name (as form
precedes name).”</p>

<p>“Tao is not too small for the greatest, nor too great
for the smallest. Thus all things are embosomed therein;
wide, indeed, its boundless capacity, unfathomable its
depth.”</p>

<p>“By no thoughts, by no cogitations, Tao may be
known. By resting in nothing, by according in nothing,
Tao may be approached. By following nothing, by
pursuing nothing, Tao may be attained.”</p>

<p>In these and many like passages Lao Tzŭ would have
been in full sympathy with his disciple. So far as it is
possible to deduce anything definite from the scanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
traditions of the teachings of Lao Tzŭ, we seem to
obtain this, that man should remain impassive under
the operation of an eternal, omnipresent law (Tao), and
that thus he will become in perfect harmony with his
environment, and that if he is in harmony with his
environment, he will thereby attain to a vague condition
of general immunity. Beyond this the teachings of Lao
Tzŭ would not carry us. Chuang Tzŭ, however, from
simple problems, such as a drunken man falling out of
a cart and not injuring himself&mdash;a common superstition
among sailors&mdash;because he is unconscious and therefore
in harmony with his environment, slides easily into
an advanced mysticism. In his marvellous chapter on
The Identity of Contraries, he maintains that from the
standpoint of Tao all things are One. Positive and
negative, this and that, here and there, somewhere and
nowhere, right and wrong, vertical and horizontal, subjective
and objective, become indistinct, as water is in
water. “When subjective and objective are both without
their correlates, that is the very axis of Tao. And
when that axis passes through the centre at which all
Infinities converge, positive and negative alike blend into
an infinite One.” This localisation in a Centre, and this
infinite absolute represented by One, were too concrete
even for Chuang Tzŭ. The One became God, and the
Centre, assigned by later Taoist writers to the pole-star
(see Book IV. ch. i.), became the source of all life and
the haven to which such life returned after its transitory
stay on earth. By ignoring the distinctions of contraries
“we are embraced in the obliterating unity of God.
Take no heed of time, nor of right and wrong; but
passing into the realm of the Infinite, make your final
rest therein.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>That the idea of an indefinite future state was familiar
to the mind of Chuang Tzŭ may be gathered from many
passages such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“How then do I know but that the dead repent of
having previously clung to life?</p>

<p>“Those who dream of the banquet, wake to lamentation
and sorrow. Those who dream of lamentation
and sorrow, wake to join the hunt. While they dream,
they do not know that they dream. Some will even
interpret the very dream they are dreaming; and only
when they awake do they know it was a dream. By
and by comes the Great Awakening, and then we find
out that this life is really a great dream. Fools think
they are awake now, and flatter themselves they know if
they are really princes or peasants. Confucius and
you are both dreams; and I who say you are dreams,&mdash;I
am but a dream myself.”</p>

<p>The chapter closes with a paragraph which has
gained for its writer an additional epithet, Butterfly
Chuang:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzŭ, dreamt I was a
butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and
purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of following
my fancies as a butterfly, and was unconscious of my individuality
as a man. Suddenly, I awaked, and there I
lay, myself again. Now I do not know whether I was
then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am
now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.”</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ is fond of paradox. He delights in
dwelling on the usefulness of useless things. He shows
that ill-grown or inferior trees are allowed to stand, that
diseased pigs are not killed for sacrifice, and that a
hunchback can not only make a good living by wash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ing,
for which a bent body is no drawback, but escapes
the dreaded press-gang in time of war.</p>

<p>With a few illustrative extracts we must now take
leave of Chuang Tzŭ, a writer who, although heterodox
in the eyes of a Confucianist, has always been justly
esteemed for his pointed wit and charming style.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(1.) “It was the time of autumn floods. Every stream
poured into the river, which swelled in its turbid course.
The banks receded so far from one another that it was
impossible to tell a cow from a horse.</p>

<p>“Then the Spirit of the River laughed for joy that all
the beauty of the earth was gathered to himself. Down
with the stream he journeyed east, until he reached the
ocean. There, looking eastwards and seeing no limit
to its waves, his countenance changed. And as he
gazed over the expanse, he sighed and said to the Spirit
of the Ocean, ‘A vulgar proverb says, that he who has
heard but part of the truth thinks no one equal to himself.
And such a one am I.</p>

<p>“‘When formerly I heard people detracting from the
learning of Confucius, or underrating the heroism of
Po I, I did not believe. But now that I have looked
upon your inexhaustibility&mdash;alas for me had I not
reached your abode, I should have been for ever a
laughing-stock to those of comprehensive enlightenment!’</p>

<p>“To which the Spirit of the Ocean replied, ‘You cannot
speak of ocean to a well-frog, the creature of a
narrower sphere. You cannot speak of ice to a summer-insect,&mdash;the
creature of a season. You cannot speak of
Tao to a pedagogue: his scope is too restricted. But
now that you have emerged from your narrow sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and have seen the great ocean, you know your own
insignificance, and I can speak to you of great
principles.’”</p>

<p>(2.) “Have you never heard of the frog in the old
well?&mdash;The frog said to the turtle of the eastern sea,
‘Happy indeed am I! I hop on to the rail around the
well. I rest in the hollow of some broken brick. Swimming,
I gather the water under my arms and shut
my mouth. I plunge into the mud, burying my feet and
toes; and not one of the cockles, crabs, or tadpoles I see
around me are my match. [Fancy pitting the happiness
of an old well, ejaculates Chuang Tzŭ, against all the
water of Ocean!] Why do you not come, sir, and pay
me a visit?’<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“Now the turtle of the eastern sea had not got its left
leg down ere its right had already stuck fast, so it shrank
back and begged to be excused. It then described
the sea, saying, ‘A thousand <i>li</i> would not measure its
breadth, nor a thousand fathoms its depth. In the days
of the Great Yü, there were nine years of flood out of
ten; but this did not add to its bulk. In the days of
T’ang, there were seven years out of eight of drought;
but this did not narrow its span. Not to be affected by
duration of time, not to be affected by volume of water,&mdash;such
is the great happiness of the eastern sea.’</p>

<p>“At this the well-frog was considerably astonished,
and knew not what to say next. And for one whose
knowledge does not reach to the positive-negative domain,
to attempt to understand me, Chuang Tzŭ, is like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
mosquito trying to carry a mountain, or an ant to swim
a river,&mdash;they cannot succeed.”</p>

<p>(3.) “Chuang Tzŭ was fishing in the P’u when the
prince of Ch’u sent two high officials to ask him to take
charge of the administration of the Ch’u State.</p>

<p>“Chuang Tzŭ went on fishing, and without turning
his head said, ‘I have heard that in Ch’u there is a sacred
tortoise which has been dead now some three thousand
years. And that the prince keeps this tortoise carefully
enclosed in a chest on the altar of his ancestral temple.
Now would this tortoise rather be dead, and have its
remains venerated, or be alive and wagging its tail in
the mud?’</p>

<p>“‘It would rather be alive,’ replied the two officials,
‘and wagging its tail in the mud.’</p>

<p>“‘Begone!’ cried Chuang Tzŭ. ‘I too will wag my
tail in the mud.’”</p>

<p>(4.) “Chuang Tzŭ one day saw an empty skull, bleached,
but still preserving its shape. Striking it with his riding
whip, he said, ‘Wert thou once some ambitious citizen
whose inordinate yearnings brought him to this pass?&mdash;some
statesman who plunged his country in ruin, and
perished in the fray?&mdash;some wretch who left behind him
a legacy of shame?&mdash;some beggar who died in the pangs
of hunger and cold? Or didst thou reach this state by
the natural course of old age?’</p>

<p>“When he had finished speaking, he took the skull,
and placing it under his head as a pillow, went to sleep.
In the night, he dreamt that the skull appeared to him,
and said, ‘You speak well, sir; but all you say has
reference to the life of mortals, and to mortal troubles.
In death there are none of these. Would you like to
hear about death?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chuang Tzŭ having replied in the affirmative, the
skull began:&mdash;‘In death, there is no sovereign above,
and no subject below. The workings of the four seasons
are unknown. Our existences are bounded only by
eternity. The happiness of a king among men cannot
exceed that which we enjoy.’</p>

<p>“Chuang Tzŭ, however, was not convinced, and said,
‘Were I to prevail upon God to allow your body to be
born again, and your bones and flesh to be renewed, so
that you could return to your parents, to your wife, and
to the friends of your youth&mdash;would you be willing?’</p>

<p>“At this, the skull opened its eyes wide and knitted its
brows and said, ‘How should I cast aside happiness
greater than that of a king, and mingle once again in the
toils and troubles of mortality?’”</p>

<p>(5.) “The Grand Augur, in his ceremonial robes, approached
the shambles and thus addressed the pigs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘How can you object to die? I shall fatten you for
three months. I shall discipline myself for ten days and
fast for three. I shall strew fine grass, and place you
bodily upon a carved sacrificial dish. Does not this
satisfy you?’</p>

<p>“Then speaking from the pigs’ point of view, he continued,
‘It is better perhaps after all to live on bran and
escape the shambles....’</p>

<p>“‘But then,’ added he, speaking from his own point
of view, ‘to enjoy honour when alive one would readily
die on a war-shield or in the headsman’s basket.’</p>

<p>“So he rejected the pigs’ point of view and adopted his
own point of view. In what sense then was he different
from the pigs?”</p>

<p>(6.) “When Chuang Tzŭ was about to die, his disciples
expressed a wish to give him a splendid funeral. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Chuang Tzŭ said, ‘With heaven and earth for my coffin
and shell, with the sun, moon, and stars as my burial
regalia, and with all creation to escort me to the grave,&mdash;are
not my funeral paraphernalia ready to hand?’</p>

<p>“‘We fear,’ argued the disciples, ‘lest the carrion kite
should eat the body of our Master’; to which Chuang
Tzŭ replied, ‘Above ground I shall be food for kites,
below I shall be food for mole-crickets and ants. Why
rob one to feed the other?’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIEH TZŬ</div>

<p>The works of <span class="smcap">Lieh Tzŭ</span>, in two thin volumes, may be
procured at any Chinese book-shop. These volumes
profess to contain the writings of a Taoist philosopher
who flourished some years before Chuang Tzŭ, and for
a long time they received considerable attention at the
hands of European students, into whose minds no
suspicion of their real character seems to have found its
way. Gradually the work came to be looked upon as
doubtful, then spurious; and now it is known to be a
forgery, possibly of the first or second century A.D.
The scholar&mdash;for he certainly was one&mdash;who took the
trouble to forge this work, was himself the victim of a
strange delusion. He thought that Lieh Tzŭ, to whom
Chuang Tzŭ devotes a whole chapter, had been a live
philosopher of flesh and blood. But he was in reality
nothing more than a figment of the imagination, like
many others of Chuang Tzŭ’s characters, though his
name was less broadly allegorical than those of All-in-Extremes,
and of Do-Nothing-Say-Nothing, and others.
The book attributed to him is curious enough to deserve
attention. It is on a lower level of thought and style
than the work of Chuang Tzŭ; still, it contains much
traditional matter and many allusions not found else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>where.
To its author we owe the famous, but of course
apocryphal, story of Confucius meeting two boys
quarrelling about the distance of the sun from the
earth. One of them said that at dawn the sun was
much larger than at noon, and must consequently be
much nearer; but the other retorted that at noon the
sun was much hotter, and therefore nearer than at dawn.
Confucius confessed himself unable to decide between
them, and was jeered at by the boys as an impostor.
But of all this work perhaps the most attractive portion
is a short story on Dream and Reality:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A man of the State of Chêng was one day gathering
fuel, when he came across a startled deer, which he
pursued and killed. Fearing lest any one should see
him, he hastily concealed the carcass in a ditch and
covered it with plaintain leaves, rejoicing excessively at
his good fortune. By and by, he forgot the place where
he had put it, and, thinking he must have been dreaming,
he set off towards home, humming over the affair
on his way.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, a man who had overheard his words,
acted upon them, and went and got the deer. The
latter, when he reached his house, told his wife, saying,
‘A woodman dreamt he had got a deer, but he did not
know where it was. Now I have got the deer; so his
dream was a reality.’ ‘It is you,’ replied his wife, ‘who
have been dreaming you saw a woodman. Did he get
the deer? and is there really such a person? It is you
who have got the deer: how, then, can his dream be a
reality?’ ‘It is true,’ assented the husband, ‘that I
have got the deer. It is therefore of little importance
whether the woodman dreamt the deer or I dreamt the
woodman.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now when the woodman reached his home, he became
much annoyed at the loss of the deer; and in the
night he actually dreamt where the deer then was, and
who had got it. So next morning he proceeded to the
place indicated in his dream,&mdash;and there it was. He then
took legal steps to recover possession; and when the
case came on, the magistrate delivered the following
judgment:&mdash;‘The plaintiff began with a real deer and an
alleged dream. He now comes forward with a real
dream and an alleged deer. The defendant really got
the deer which plaintiff said he dreamt, and is now
trying to keep it; while, according to his wife, both the
woodman and the deer are but the figments of a dream,
so that no one got the deer at all. However, here is a
deer, which you had better divide between you.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAN FEI TZŬ</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Han Fei Tzŭ</span>, who died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 233, has left us fifty-five
essays of considerable value, partly for the light they
throw upon the connection between the genuine sayings
of Lao Tzŭ and the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, and partly for the quaint
illustrations he gives of the meaning of the sayings
themselves. He was deeply read in law, and obtained
favour in the eyes of the First Emperor (see Book II.,
ch. i.); but misrepresentations of rivals brought about
his downfall, and he committed suicide in prison. We
cannot imagine that he had before him the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.
He deals with many of its best sayings, which
may well have come originally from an original teacher,
such as Lao Tzŭ is supposed to have been, but quite at
random and not as if he took them from an orderly
work. And what is more, portions of his own commentary
have actually slipped into the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite> as
text, showing how this book was pieced together from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
various sources. Again, he quotes sentences not to be
found in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. He illustrates such a
simple saying as “To see small beginnings is clearness
of sight,” by drawing attention to a man who foresaw,
when the tyrant Chou Hsin (who died <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1122) took to
ivory chopsticks, that the tide of luxury had set in, to
bring licentiousness and cruelty in its train, and to
end in downfall and death.</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, “Leave all things to take their natural
course.” To this Han Fei Tzŭ adds, “A man spent
three years in carving a leaf out of ivory, of such elegant
and detailed workmanship that it would lie undetected
among a heap of real leaves. But Lieh Tzŭ said, ‘If
God Almighty were to spend three years over every leaf,
the trees would be badly off for foliage.’”</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, “The wise man takes time by the forelock.”
Han Fei Tzŭ adds, “One day the Court physician
said to Duke Huan, ‘Your Grace is suffering from an
affection of the muscular system. Take care, or it may
become serious.’ ‘Oh no,’ replied the Duke, ‘I have
nothing the matter with me;’ and when the physician
was gone, he observed to his courtiers, ‘Doctors dearly
love to treat patients who are not ill, and then make
capital out of the cure.’ Ten days afterwards, the Court
physician again remarked, ‘Your Grace has an affection
of the flesh. Take care, or it may become serious.’
The Duke took no notice of this, but after ten days
more the physician once more observed, ‘Your Grace
has an affection of the viscera. Take care, or it may
become serious.’ Again the Duke paid no heed; and
ten days later, when the physician came, he simply
looked at his royal patient, and departed without saying
anything. The Duke sent some one to inquire what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was the matter, and to him the physician said, ‘As long
as the disease was in the muscles, it might have been
met by fomentations and hot applications; when it was
in the flesh, acupuncture might have been employed;
and as long as it was in the viscera, cauterisation might
have been tried; but now it is in the bones and marrow,
and naught will avail.’ Five days later, the Duke
felt pains all over his body, and sent to summon his
physician; but the physician had fled, and the Duke
died. So it is that the skilful doctor attacks disease
while it is still in the muscles and easy to deal with.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUAI-NAN TZŬ</div>

<p>To clear off finally this school of early Taoist writers,
it will be necessary to admit here one whose life properly
belongs to the next period. Liu An, a grandson
of the founder of the Han dynasty, became Prince of
Huai-nan, and it is as <span class="smcap">Huai-nan Tzŭ</span>, the Philosopher
of that ilk, that he is known to the Chinese people. He
wrote an esoteric work in twenty-one chapters, which we
are supposed still to possess, besides many exoteric works,
such as a treatise on alchemy, none of which are extant.
It is fairly certain, however, that alchemy was not
known to the Chinese until between two and three
centuries later, when it was introduced from the West.
As to the book which passes under his name, it is
difficult to assign to it any exact date. Like the work
of Lieh Tzŭ, it is interesting enough in itself; and what
is more important, it marks the transition of the pure
and simple Way of Lao Tzŭ, etherealised by Chuang
Tzŭ, to the grosser beliefs of later ages in magicians and
the elixir of life. Lao Tzŭ urged his fellow-mortals to
guard their vitality by entering into harmony with their
environment. Chuang Tzŭ added a motive, “to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
into the realm of the Infinite and make one’s final rest
therein.” From which it is but a step to immortality
and the elixir of life.</p>

<p>Huai-nan Tzŭ begins with a lengthy disquisition “On
the Nature of Tao,” in which, as elsewhere, he deals with
the sayings of Lao Tzŭ after the fashion of Han Fei
Tzŭ. Thus Lao Tzŭ said, “If you do not quarrel, no
one on earth will be able to quarrel with you.” To this
Huai-nan Tzŭ adds, that when a certain ruler was besieging
an enemy’s town, a large part of the wall fell
down; whereupon the former gave orders to beat a
retreat at once. “For,” said he in reply to the remonstrances
of his officers, “a gentleman never hits a man
who is down. Let them rebuild their wall, and then we
will renew the attack.” This noble behaviour so delighted
the enemy that they tendered allegiance on the
spot.</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, “Do not value the man, value his
abilities.” Whereupon Huai-nan Tzŭ tells a story of
a general of the Ch’u State who was fond of surrounding
himself with men of ability, and once even
went so far as to engage a man who represented himself
as a master-thief. His retainers were aghast; but shortly
afterwards their State was attacked by the Ch’i State, and
then, when fortune was adverse and all was on the point
of being lost, the master-thief begged to be allowed to
try his skill. He went by night into the enemy’s camp,
and stole their general’s bed-curtain. This was returned
next morning with a message that it had been found by
one of the soldiers who was gathering fuel. The same
night our master-thief stole the general’s pillow, which
was restored with a similar message; and the following
night he stole the long pin used to secure the hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“Good heavens!” cried the general at a council of war,
“they will have my head next.” Upon which the army
of the Ch’i State was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Among passages of general interest the following may
well be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Once when the Duke of Lu-yang was at war with
the Han State, and sunset drew near while a battle was
still fiercely raging, the Duke held up his spear, and
shook it at the sun, which forthwith went back three
zodiacal signs.”</p>

<p>The end of this philosopher was a tragic one. He
seems to have mixed himself up in some treasonable
enterprise, and was driven to commit suicide. Tradition,
however, says that he positively discovered the elixir of
immortality, and that after drinking of it he rose up to
heaven in broad daylight. Also that, in his excitement,
he dropped the vessel which had contained this elixir
into his courtyard, and that his dogs and poultry sipped
up the dregs, and immediately sailed up to heaven after
him!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

THE “FIRST EMPEROR”&mdash;THE BURNING OF
THE BOOKS&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS WRITERS</h3>


<p>Never has the literature of any country been more
closely bound up with the national history than was
that of China at the beginning of the period upon which
we are now about to enter.</p>

<p>The feudal spirit had long since declined, and the
bond between suzerain and vassal had grown weaker
and weaker until at length it had ceased to exist. Then
came the opportunity and the man. The ruler of the
powerful State of Ch’in, after gradually vanquishing and
absorbing such of the other rival States as had not
already been swallowed up by his own State, found
himself in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 221 master of the whole of China, and
forthwith proclaimed himself its Emperor. The Chou
dynasty, with its eight hundred years of sway, was a
thing of the past, and the whole fabric of feudalism
melted easily away.</p>

<p>This catastrophe was by no means unexpected. Some
forty years previously a politician, named Su Tai, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one day advising the King of Chao to put an end to his
ceaseless hostilities with the Yen State. “This morning,”
said he, “when crossing the river, I saw a mussel open
its shell to sun itself. Immediately an oyster-catcher
thrust in his bill to eat the mussel, but the latter
promptly closed its shell and held the bird fast. ‘If it
doesn’t rain to-day or to-morrow,’ cried the oyster-catcher,
‘there will be a dead mussel.’ ‘And if you
don’t get out of this by to-day or to-morrow,’ retorted
the mussel, ‘there will be a dead oyster-catcher.’ Meanwhile
up came a fisherman and carried off both of them.
I fear lest the Ch’in State should be our fisherman.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LI SSŬ</div>

<p>The new Emperor was in many senses a great man,
and civilisation made considerable advances during his
short reign. But a single decree has branded his name
with infamy, to last so long as the Chinese remain a
lettered people. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 13, a trusted Minister, named
Li Ssŭ, is said to have suggested an extraordinary plan,
by which the claims of antiquity were to be for ever
blotted out and history was to begin again with the
ruling monarch, thenceforward to be famous as the
First Emperor. All existing literature was to be destroyed,
with the exception only of works relating to
agriculture, medicine, and divination; and a penalty of
branding and four years’ work on the Great Wall, then
in process of building, was enacted against all who
refused to surrender their books for destruction. This
plan was carried out with considerable vigour. Many
valuable works perished; and the Confucian Canon
would have been irretrievably lost but for the devotion
of scholars, who at considerable risk concealed the
tablets by which they set such store, and thus made
possible the discoveries of the following century and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
restoration of the sacred text. So many, indeed, of the
literati are said to have been put to death for disobedience
that melons actually grew in winter on the
spot beneath which their bodies were buried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Li Ssŭ</span> was a scholar himself, and the reputed inventor
of the script known as the Lesser Seal, which was in
vogue for several centuries. The following is from a
memorial of his against the proscription of nobles and
others from rival States:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As broad acres yield large crops, so for a nation to
be great there should be a great population; and for
soldiers to be daring their generals should be brave.
Not a single clod was added to T’ai-shan in vain: hence
the huge mountain we now behold. The merest streamlet
is received into the bosom of Ocean: hence the
Ocean’s unfathomable expanse. And wise and virtuous
is the ruler who scorns not the masses below. For
him, no boundaries of realm, no distinctions of nationality
exist. The four seasons enrich him; the Gods
bless him; and, like our rulers of old, no man’s hand is
against him.”</p>

<p>The First Emperor died in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 210,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and his feeble
son, the Second Emperor, was put to death in 207, thus
bringing their line to an end. The vacant throne was
won by a quondam beadle, who established the glorious
House of Han, in memory of which Chinese of the
present day, chiefly in the north, are still proud to call
themselves Sons of Han.</p>

<p>So soon as the empire settled down to comparative
peace, a mighty effort was made to undo at least some of
the mischief sustained by the national literature. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
extra impetus was given to this movement by the fact
that under the First Emperor, if we can believe tradition,
the materials of writing had undergone a radical change.
A general, named Mêng T’ien, added to the triumphs of
the sword the invention of the camel’s-hair brush, which
the Chinese use as a pen. The clumsy bamboo tablet
and stylus were discarded, and strips of cloth or silk
came into general use, and were so employed until the
first century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, when paper was invented by Ts’ai Lun.
Some say that brickdust and water did duty at first for
ink. However that may be, the form of the written
character underwent a corresponding change to suit the
materials employed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, books were brought out of their hiding-places,
and scholars like <span class="smcap">K’ung An-kuo</span>, a descendant of
Confucius in the twelfth degree, set to work to restore the
lost classics. He deciphered the text of the Book of
History, which had been discovered when pulling down
the old house where Confucius once lived, and transcribed
large portions of it from the ancient into the later
script. He also wrote a commentary on the Analects
and another on the Filial Piety Classic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CH’AO TS’O&mdash;LI LING</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch’ao Ts’o</span> (perished <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 155), popularly known as
Wisdom-Bag, was a statesman rather than an author.
Still, many of his memorials to the throne were considered
masterpieces, and have been preserved accordingly. He
wrote on the military operations against the Huns, pleading
for the employment of frontier tribes, “barbarians,
who in point of food and skill are closely allied to the
Huns.” “But arms,” he says, “are a curse, and war
is a dread thing. For in the twinkling of an eye the
mighty may be humbled, and the strong may be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
low.” In an essay “On the Value of Agriculture” he
writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Crime begins in poverty; poverty in insufficiency
of food; insufficiency of food in neglect of agriculture.
Without agriculture, man has no tie to bind him to
the soil. Without such tie he readily leaves his birth-place
and his home. He is like unto the birds of the
air or the beasts of the field. Neither battlemented
cities, nor deep moats, nor harsh laws, nor cruel punishments,
can subdue this roving spirit that is strong within
him.</p>

<p>“He who is cold examines not the quality of cloth;
he who is hungry tarries not for choice meats. When
cold and hunger come upon men, honesty and shame
depart. As man is constituted, he must eat twice daily,
or hunger; he must wear clothes, or be cold. And if the
stomach cannot get food and the body clothes, the love
of the fondest mother cannot keep her children at her
side. How then should a sovereign keep his subjects
gathered around him?</p>

<p>“The wise ruler knows this. Therefore he concentrates
the energies of his people upon agriculture. He
levies light taxes. He extends the system of grain storage,
to provide for his subjects at times when their resources
fail.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LI LING</div>

<p>The name of <span class="smcap">Li Ling</span> (second and first centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.)</span>
is a familiar one to every Chinese schoolboy. He was a
military official who was sent in command of 800 horse
to reconnoitre the territory of the Huns; and returning
successful from this expedition, he was promoted to a
high command and was again employed against these
troublesome neighbours. With a force of only 5000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
infantry he penetrated into the Hun territory as far as
Mount Ling-chi (?), where he was surrounded by an
army of 30,000 of the Khan’s soldiers; and when his
troops had exhausted all their arrows, he was forced to
surrender. At this the Emperor was furious; and later
on, when he heard that Li Ling was training the Khan’s
soldiers in the art of war as then practised by the
Chinese, he caused his mother, wife, and children to be
put to death. Li Ling remained some twenty years,
until his death, with the Huns, and was highly honoured
by the Khan, who gave him his daughter to wife.</p>

<p>With the renegade Li Ling is associated his patriot
contemporary, <span class="smcap">Su Wu</span>, who also met with strange adventures
among the Huns. Several Chinese envoys
had been imprisoned by the latter, and not allowed
to return; and by way of reprisal, Hun envoys
had been imprisoned in China. But a new Khan
had recently sent back all the imprisoned envoys,
and in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 100 Su Wu was despatched upon a
mission of peace to return the Hun envoys who had
been detained by the Chinese. Whilst at the Court
of the Khan his fellow-envoys revolted, and on the
strength of this an attempt was made to persuade him
to throw off his allegiance and enter the service of the
Huns; upon which he tried to commit suicide, and
wounded himself so severely that he lay unconscious for
some hours. He subsequently slew a Chinese renegade
with his own hand; and then when it was found that he
was not to be forced into submission, he was thrown
into a dungeon and left without food for several days.
He kept himself alive by sucking snow and gnawing a
felt rug; and at length the Huns, thinking that he was a
supernatural being, sent him away north and set him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tend sheep. Then Li Ling was ordered to try once
more by brilliant offers to shake his unswerving loyalty,
but all was in vain. In the year 86, peace was made
with the Huns, and the Emperor asked for the return of
Su Wu. To this the Huns replied that he was dead;
but a former assistant to Su Wu bade the new envoy
tell the Khan that the Emperor had shot a goose with a
letter tied to its leg, from which he had learnt the whereabouts
of his missing envoy. This story so astonished
the Khan that Su Wu was released, and in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>. 81
returned to China after a captivity of nineteen years.
He had gone away in the prime of life; he returned a
white-haired and broken-down old man.</p>

<p>Li Ling and Su Wu are said to have exchanged poems
at parting, and these are to be found published in
collections under their respective names. Some doubt
has been cast upon the genuineness of one of those attributed
to Li Ling. It was pointed out by Hung Mai, a
brilliant critic of the twelfth century, that a certain word
was used in the poem, which, being part of the personal
name of a recent Emperor, would at that date have been
taboo. No such stigma attaches to the verses by Su Wu,
who further gave to his wife a parting poem, which has
been preserved, promising her that if he lived he would
not fail to return, and if he died he would never forget
her. But most famous of all, and still a common model
for students, is a letter written by Li Ling to Su Wu,
after the latter’s return to China, in reply to an affectionate
appeal to him to return also. Its genuineness
has been questioned by Su Shih of the Sung dynasty,
but not by the greatest of modern critics, Lin Hsi-chung,
who declares that its pathos is enough to make
even the gods weep, and that it cannot possibly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
come from any other hand save that of Li Ling. With
this verdict the foreign student may well rest content.
Here is the letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O Tzŭ-ch’ing, O my friend, happy in the enjoyment
of a glorious reputation, happy in the prospect of an
imperishable name,&mdash;there is no misery like exile in a
far-off foreign land, the heart brimful of longing
thoughts of home! I have thy kindly letter, bidding
me of good cheer, kinder than a brother’s words; for
which my soul thanks thee.</p>

<p>“Ever since the hour of my surrender until now,
destitute of all resource, I have sat alone with the bitterness
of my grief. All day long I see none but barbarians
around me. Skins and felt protect me from wind and
rain. With mutton and whey I satisfy my hunger and
slake my thirst. Companions with whom to while time
away, I have none. The whole country is stiff with
black ice. I hear naught but the moaning of the bitter
autumn blast, beneath which all vegetation has disappeared.
I cannot sleep at night. I turn and listen to
the distant sound of Tartar pipes, to the whinnying of
Tartar steeds. In the morning I sit up and listen still,
while tears course down my cheeks. O Tzŭ-ch’ing, of
what stuff am I, that I should do aught but grieve?
The day of thy departure left me disconsolate indeed.
I thought of my aged mother butchered upon the
threshold of the grave. I thought of my innocent wife
and child, condemned to the same cruel fate. Deserving
as I might have been of Imperial censure, I am now
an object of pity to all. Thy return was to honour and
renown, while I remained behind with infamy and disgrace.
Such is the divergence of man’s destiny.</p>

<p>“Born within the domain of refinement and justice, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
passed into an environment of vulgar ignorance. I left
behind me obligations to sovereign and family for life
amid barbarian hordes; and now barbarian children
will carry on the line of my forefathers. And yet my
merit was great, my guilt of small account. I had no
fair hearing; and when I pause to think of these things,
I ask to what end I have lived? With a thrust I could
have cleared myself of all blame: my severed throat
would have borne witness to my resolution; and between
me and my country all would have been over for
aye. But to kill myself would have been of no avail:
I should only have added to my shame. I therefore
steeled myself to obloquy and to life. There were not
wanting those who mistook my attitude for compliance,
and urged me to a nobler course; ignorant that the
joys of a foreign land are sources only of a keener
grief.</p>

<p>“O Tzŭ-ch’ing, O my friend, I will complete the half-told
record of my former tale. His late Majesty commissioned
me, with five thousand infantry under my
command, to carry on operations in a distant country.
Five brother generals missed their way: I alone reached
the theatre of war. With rations for a long march,
leading on my men, I passed beyond the limits of the
Celestial Land, and entered the territory of the fierce
Huns. With five thousand men I stood opposed to a
hundred thousand: mine jaded foot-soldiers, theirs
horsemen fresh from the stable. Yet we slew their
leaders, and captured their standards, and drove them
back in confusion towards the north. We obliterated
their very traces: we swept them away like dust: we
beheaded their general. A martial spirit spread abroad
among my men. With them, to die in battle was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
return to their homes; while I&mdash;I venture to think that
I had already accomplished something.</p>

<p>“This victory was speedily followed by a general rising
of the Huns. New levies were trained to the use of arms,
and at length another hundred thousand barbarians were
arrayed against me. The Hun chieftain himself appeared,
and with his army surrounded my little band,
so unequal in strength,&mdash;foot-soldiers opposed to horse.
Still my tired veterans fought, each man worth a thousand
of the foe, as, covered with wounds, one and all
struggled bravely to the fore. The plain was strewed
with the dying and the dead: barely a hundred men
were left, and these too weak to hold a spear and shield.
Yet, when I waved my hand and shouted to them, the
sick and wounded arose. Brandishing their blades, and
pointing towards the foe, they dismissed the Tartar
cavalry like a rabble rout. And even when their arms
were gone, their arrows spent, without a foot of steel in
their hands, they still rushed, yelling, onward, each eager
to lead the way. The very heavens and the earth seemed
to gather round me, while my warriors drank tears of
blood. Then the Hunnish chieftain, thinking that we
should not yield, would have drawn off his forces. But
a false traitor told him all: the battle was renewed, and
we were lost.</p>

<p>“The Emperor Kao Ti, with 300,000 men at his back,
was shut up in P’ing-ch’êng. Generals he had, like
clouds; counsellors, like drops of rain. Yet he remained
seven days without food, and then barely escaped with
life. How much more then I, now blamed on all sides
that I did not die? This was my crime. But, O Tzŭ-ch’ing,
canst thou say that I would live from craven fear
of death? Am I one to turn my back on my country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and all those dear to me, allured by sordid thoughts of
gain? It was not indeed without cause that I did not
elect to die. I longed, as explained in my former
letter, to prove my loyalty to my prince. Rather than
die to no purpose, I chose to live and to establish my
good name. It was better to achieve something than to
perish. Of old, Fan Li did not slay himself after the
battle of Hui-chi; neither did Ts’ao Mo die after the
ignominy of three defeats. Revenge came at last; and
thus I too had hoped to prevail. Why then was I overtaken
with punishment before the plan was matured?
Why were my own flesh and blood condemned before
the design could be carried out? It is for this that I
raise my face to Heaven, and beating my breast, shed
tears of blood.</p>

<p>“O my friend, thou sayest that the House of Han
never fails to reward a deserving servant. But thou art
thyself a servant of the House, and it would ill beseem
thee to say other words than these. Yet Hsiao and Fan
were bound in chains; Han and P’êng were sliced to
death; Ch’ao Ts’o was beheaded. Chou Po was disgraced,
and Tou Ying paid the penalty with his life.
Others, great in their generation, have also succumbed
to the intrigues of base men, and have been overwhelmed
beneath a weight of shame from which they were unable
to emerge. And now, the misfortunes of Fan Li and
Ts’ao Mo command the sympathies of all.</p>

<p>“My grandfather filled heaven and earth with the
fame of his exploits&mdash;the bravest of the brave. Yet,
fearing the animosity of an Imperial favourite, he slew
himself in a distant land, his death being followed by the
secession, in disgust, of many a brother-hero. Can this
be the reward of which thou speakest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thou too, O my friend, an envoy with a slender
equipage, sent on that mission to the robber race, when
fortune failed thee even to the last resource of the
dagger. Then years of miserable captivity, all but ended
by death among the wilds of the far north. Thou left
us full of young life, to return a graybeard; thy old
mother dead, thy wife gone from thee to another.
Seldom has the like of this been known. Even the
savage barbarian respected thy loyal spirit: how much
more the lord of all under the canopy of the sky? A
many-acred barony should have been thine, the ruler of
a thousand-charioted fief! Nevertheless, they tell me
’twas but two paltry millions, and the chancellorship of
the Tributary States. Not a foot of soil repaid thee for
the past, while some cringing courtier gets the marquisate
of ten thousand families, and each greedy parasite of
the Imperial house is gratified by the choicest offices of
the State. If then thou farest thus, what could I expect?
I have been heavily repaid for that I did not die. Thou
hast been meanly rewarded for thy unswerving devotion
to thy prince. This is barely that which should attract
the absent servant back to his fatherland.</p>

<p>“And so it is that I do not now regret the past.
Wanting though I may have been in my duty to the
State, the State was wanting also in gratitude towards
me. It was said of old, ‘A loyal subject, though not a
hero, will rejoice to die for his country.’ I would die
joyfully even now; but the stain of my prince’s ingratitude
can never be wiped away. Indeed, if the brave
man is not to be allowed to achieve a name, but must die
like a dog in a barbarian land, who will be found to crook
the back and bow the knee before an Imperial throne,
where the bitter pens of courtiers tell their lying tales?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“O my friend, look for me no more. O Tzŭ-ch’ing,
what shall I say? A thousand leagues lie between us,
and separate us for ever. I shall live out my life as it
were in another sphere: my spirit will find its home
among a strange people. Accept my last adieu. Speak
for me to my old acquaintances, and bid them serve
their sovereign well. O my friend, be happy in the
bosom of thy family, and think of me no more. Strive
to take all care of thyself; and when time and opportunity
are thine, write me once again in reply.</p>

<p>“Li Ling salutes thee!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LU WÊN-SHU</div>

<p>One of the Chinese models of self-help alluded to in
the <cite>San Tzŭ Ching</cite>, the famous school primer, to be
described later on, is <span class="smcap">Lu Wên-shu</span> (first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>).
The son of a village gaoler, he was sent by his father
to tend sheep, in which capacity he seems to have
formed sheets of writing material by plaiting rushes, and
otherwise to have succeeded in educating himself. He
became an assistant in a prison, and there the knowledge
of law which he had picked up stood him in such good
stead that he was raised to a higher position; and then,
attracting the notice of the governor, he was still further
advanced, and finally took his degree, ultimately rising
to the rank of governor. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 67 he submitted to
the throne the following well-known memorial:&mdash;</p>

<p>“May it please your Majesty.</p>

<p>“Of the ten great follies of our predecessors, one
still survives in the maladministration of justice which
prevails.</p>

<p>“Under the Ch’ins learning was at a discount; brute
force carried everything before it. Those who cultivated
a spirit of charity and duty towards their neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>bour
were despised. Judicial appointments were the
prizes coveted by all. He who spoke out the truth was
stigmatised as a slanderer, and he who strove to expose
abuses was set down as a pestilent fellow. Consequently
all who acted up to the precepts of our ancient code
found themselves out of place in their generation, and
loyal words of good advice to the sovereign remained
locked up within their bosoms, while hollow notes of
obsequious flattery soothed the monarch’s ear and lulled
his heart with false images, to the exclusion of disagreeable
realities. And so the rod of empire fell from their
grasp for ever.</p>

<p>“At the present moment the State rests upon the
immeasurable bounty and goodness of your Majesty.
We are free from the horrors of war, from the calamities
of hunger and cold. Father and son, husband and wife,
are united in their happy homes. Nothing is wanting
to make this a golden age save only reform in the
administration of justice.</p>

<p>“Of all trusts, this is the greatest and most sacred.
The dead man can never come back to life: that which
is once cut off cannot be joined again. ‘Rather than
slay an innocent man, it were better that the guilty
escape.’ Such, however, is not the view of our judicial
authorities of to-day. With them, oppression and severity
are reckoned to be signs of magisterial acumen and
lead on to fortune, whereas leniency entails naught
but trouble. Therefore their chief aim is to compass
the death of their victims; not that they entertain any
grudge against humanity in general, but simply that this
is the shortest cut to their own personal advantage.
Thus, our market-places run with blood, our criminals
throng the gaols, and many thousands annually suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
death. These things are injurious to public morals and
hinder the advent of a truly golden age.</p>

<p>“Man enjoys life only when his mind is at peace;
when he is in distress, his thoughts turn towards death.
Beneath the scourge what is there that cannot be wrung
from the lips of the sufferer? His agony is overwhelming,
and he seeks to escape by speaking falsely. The
officials profit by the opportunity, and cause him to say
what will best confirm his guilt. And then, fearing lest
the conviction be quashed by higher courts, they dress
the victim’s deposition to suit the circumstances of the
case, so that, when the record is complete, even were
Kao Yao<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> himself to rise from the dead, he would
declare that death still left a margin of unexpiated crime.
This, because of the refining process adopted to ensure
the establishment of guilt.</p>

<p>“Our magistrates indeed think of nothing else. They
are the bane of the people. They keep in view their
own ends, and care not for the welfare of the State.
Truly they are the worst criminals of the age. Hence
the saying now runs, ‘Chalk out a prison on the ground,
and no one would remain within. Set up a gaoler of
wood, and he will be found standing there alone.’<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Imprisonment has become the greatest of all misfortunes,
while among those who break the law, who
violate family ties, who choke the truth, there are none
to be compared in iniquity with the officers of justice
themselves.</p>

<p>“Where you let the kite rear its young undisturbed,
there will the phœnix come and build its nest. Do
not punish for misguided advice, and by and by valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
suggestions will flow in. The men of old said, ‘Hills
and jungles shelter many noxious things; rivers and
marshes receive much filth; even the finest gems are
not wholly without flaw. Surely then the ruler of an
empire should put up with a little abuse.’ But I would
have your Majesty exempt from vituperation, and open
to the advice of all who have aught to say. I would
have freedom of speech in the advisers of the throne.
I would sweep away the errors which brought the
downfall of our predecessors. I would have reverence
for the virtues of our ancient kings and reform in the
administration of justice, to the utter confusion of those
who now pervert its course. Then indeed would the
golden age be renewed over the face of the glad earth,
and the people would move ever onwards in peace and
happiness boundless as the sky itself.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Liu Hsiang</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 80-89) was a descendant of the beadle
founder of the great Han dynasty. Entering into official
life, he sought to curry favour with the reigning Emperor
by submitting some secret works on the black art,
towards which his Majesty was much inclined. The
results not proving successful, he was thrown into
prison, but was soon released that he might carry on
the publication of the commentary on the Spring and
Autumn by Ku-liang. He also revised and re-arranged
the historical episodes known as the <cite>Chan Kuo Ts’ê</cite>,
wrote treatises on government and some poetry, and
compiled Biographies of Eminent Women, the first
work of its kind.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="smcap">Liu Hsin</span>, was a precocious boy, who early
distinguished himself by wide reading in all branches of
literature. He worked with his father upon the restora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>tion
of the classical texts, especially of the Book of
Changes, and later on was chiefly instrumental in establishing
the position of Tso’s Commentary on the Spring
and Autumn. He catalogued the Imperial Library, and
in conjunction with his father discovered&mdash;some say
compiled&mdash;the Chou Ritual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">YANG HSIUNG</div>

<p>A well-known figure in Chinese literature is <span class="smcap">Yang
Hsiung</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 53-<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 18). As a boy he was fond of
straying from the beaten track and reading whatever
he could lay his hands on. He stammered badly,
and consequently gave much time to meditation. He
propounded an ethical criterion occupying a middle
place between those insisted upon by Mencius and by
Hsün K’uang, teaching that the nature of man at birth
is neither good nor evil, but a mixture of both, and
that development in either direction depends wholly
upon environment. In glorification of the Book of
Changes he wrote the <cite>T’ai Hsüan Ching</cite>, and to emphasise
the value of the Confucian Analects he produced
a philosophical treatise known as the <cite>Fa Yen</cite>,
both between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1 and 6. On completion of this last,
his most famous work, a wealthy merchant of the province
was so struck by its excellence that he offered to
give 100,000 <i>cash</i> if his name should merely be mentioned
in it. But Yang answered with scorn that a stag in a
pen or an ox in a cage would not be more out of place
than the name of a man with nothing but money to
recommend him in the sacred pages of a book. Liu
Hsin, however, sneeringly suggested that posterity would
use Yang Hsiung’s work to cover pickle-jars.</p>

<p>Besides composing some mediocre poetry, Yang
Hsiung wrote on acupuncture, music, and philology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
There is little doubt that he did not write the <cite>Fang
Yen</cite>, a vocabulary of words and phrases used in various
parts of the empire, which was steadily attributed to
him until Hung Mai, a critic of the twelfth century,
already mentioned in Chapter I. of this Book, made
short work of his claims.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A brilliant writer who attracted much attention in
his day was <span class="smcap">Wang Ch’ung</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 27-97). He is said to
have picked up his education at bookstalls, with the
aid of a superbly retentive memory. Only one of his
works is extant, the <cite>Lun Hêng</cite>, consisting of eighty-five
essays on a variety of subjects. In these he tilts against
the errors of the age, and exposes even Confucius and
Mencius to free and searching criticisms. He is consequently
ranked as a heterodox thinker. He showed that
the soul could neither exist after death as a spirit nor
exercise any influence upon the living. When the body
decomposes, the soul, a phenomenon inseparable from
vitality, perishes with it. He further argued that if the
souls of human beings were immortal, those of animals
would be immortal likewise; and that space itself would
not suffice to contain the countless shades of the men
and creatures of all time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ma Jung</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 79-166) was popularly known as the
Universal Scholar. His learning in Confucian lore was
profound, and he taught upwards of one thousand
pupils. He introduced the system of printing notes or
comments in the body of the page, using for that purpose
smaller characters cut in double columns; and it
was by a knowledge of this fact that a clever critic of the
T’ang dynasty was able to settle the spuriousness of an
early edition of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite> with double-column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
commentary, which had been attributed to Ho Shang
Kung, a writer of the second century B.C.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TS’AI YUNG&mdash;CHÊNG HSÜAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ts’ai Yung</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 133-192), whose tippling propensities
earned for him the nickname of the Drunken
Dragon, is chiefly remembered in connection with
literature as superintending the work of engraving on
stone the authorised text of the Five Classics. With red
ink he wrote these out on forty-six tablets for the workmen
to cut. The tablets were placed in the Hung-tu
College, and fragments of them are said to be still in
existence.</p>

<p>The most famous of the pupils who sat at the feet of
Ma Jung was <span class="smcap">Chêng Hsüan</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 127-200). He is one
of the most voluminous of all the commentators upon
the Confucian classics. He lived for learning. The
very slave-girls of his household were highly educated,
and interlarded their conversation with quotations from
the Odes. He was nevertheless fond of wine, and is said
to have been able to take three hundred cups at a sitting
without losing his head. Perhaps it may be as well
to add that a Chinese cup holds about a thimbleful. As
an instance of the general respect in which he was held,
it is recorded that at his request the chief of certain rebels
spared the town of Kao-mi (his native place), marching
forward by another route. In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 200 Confucius appeared
to him in a vision, and he knew by this token
that his hour was at hand. Consequently, he was very
loth to respond to a summons sent to him from Chi-chou
in Chihli by the then powerful Yüan Shao. He set out
indeed upon the journey, but died on the way.</p>

<p>It is difficult to bring the above writers, representatives
of a class, individually to the notice of the reader. Though
each one wandered into by-paths of his own, the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
lode-star was Confucianism&mdash;elucidation of the Confucian
Canon. For although, with us, commentaries upon the
classics are not usually regarded as literature, they are
so regarded by the Chinese, who place such works in the
very highest rank, and reward successful commentators
with the coveted niche in the Confucian temple.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

POETRY</h3>


<p>At the beginning of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, poetry
was still composed on the model of the <cite>Li Sao</cite>, and
we are in possession of a number of works assigned
to Chia I (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 199-168), Tung-fang So (<i>b.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 160),
Liu Hsiang, and others, all of which follow on the
lines of Ch’ü Yüan’s great poem. But gradually,
with the more definite establishment of what we may
call classical influence, poets went back to find their
exemplars in the Book of Poetry, which came as it were
from the very hand of Confucius himself. Poems were
written in metres of four, five, and seven words to a
line. Ssŭ-ma Hsiang-ju (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 117), a gay Lothario
who eloped with a young widow, made such a name
with his verses that he was summoned to Court, and
appointed by the Emperor to high office. His poems,
however, have not survived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mei Shêng</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 140), who formed his style on
Ssŭ-ma, has the honour of being the first to bring home
to his fellow-countrymen the extreme beauty of the five-word
metre. From him modern poetry may be said to
date. Many specimens of his workmanship are extant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIU-HÊNG&mdash;LIU CH’Ê</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Liu Hêng</span> (<i>d</i>. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 157) was the son by a concubine of
the founder of the Han dynasty, and succeeded in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 180
as fourth Emperor of the line. For over twenty years
he ruled wisely and well. He is one of the twenty-four
classical examples of filial piety, having waited on his sick
mother for three years without changing his clothes. He
was a scholar, and was canonised after death by a title
which may fairly be rendered “Beauclerc.” The following
is a poem which he wrote on the death of his illustrious
father, who, if we can accept as genuine the remains
attributed to him, was himself also a poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I look up, the curtains are there as of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look down, and there is the mat on the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things I behold, but the man is no more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To the infinite azure his spirit has flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am left friendless, uncared-for, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of solace bereft, save to weep and to moan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The deer on the hillside caressingly bleat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offer the grass for their young ones to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While birds of the air to their nestlings bring meat<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“But I a poor orphan must ever remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart, still so young, overburdened with pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him I shall never set eyes on again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis a well-worn old saying, which all men allow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grief stamps the deepest of lines on the brow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for my hair, it is silvery now!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Alas for my father, cut off in his pride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas that no more I may stand by his side!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, where were the gods when that great hero died?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The literary fame of the Beauclerc was rivalled, if not
surpassed, by his grandson, <span class="smcap">Liu Ch’ê</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 156-87), who
succeeded in <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 140 as sixth Emperor of the Han
dynasty. He was an enthusiastic patron of literature.
He devoted great attention to music as a factor in
national life. He established important religious sacrifices
to heaven and earth. He caused the calendar to
be reformed by his grand astrologer, the historian <span class="smcap">Ssŭ-ma
Ch’ien</span>, from which date accurate chronology may be
almost said to begin. His generals carried the Imperial
arms into Central Asia, and for many years the Huns
were held in check. Notwithstanding his enlightened
policy, the Emperor was personally much taken up with
the magic and mysteries which were being gradually
grafted on to the Tao of Lao Tzŭ, and he encouraged
the numerous quacks who pretended to have discovered
the elixir of life. The following are specimens of his
skill in poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The autumn blast drives the white scud in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves fade, and wild geese sweeping south meet the eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scent of late flowers fills the soft air above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart full of thoughts of the lady I love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the river the barges for revel-carouse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are lined by white waves which break over their bows;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their oarsmen keep time to the piping and drumming....<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Yet joy is as naught<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Alloyed by the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That youth slips away and that old age is coming.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next lines were written upon the death of a harem
favourite, to whom he was fondly attached:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The sound of rustling silk is stilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dust the marble courtyard filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No footfalls echo on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen leaves in heaps block up the door....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she, my pride, my lovely one, is lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am left, in hopeless anguish tossed.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A good many anonymous poems have come down to
us from the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and some of these contain
here and there quaint and pleasing conceits, as, for
instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Man reaches scarce a hundred, yet his tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would fill a lifetime of a thousand years.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following is a poem of this period, the author of
which is unknown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Forth from the eastern gate my steeds I drive,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And dress in silk and satin every day!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE LADY PAN</div>

<p>Women now begin to appear in Chinese literature.
The Lady <span class="smcap">Pan</span> was for a long time chief favourite of the
Emperor who ruled China <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 32-6. So devoted was
his Majesty that he even wished her to appear alongside
of him in the Imperial chariot. Upon which she replied,
“Your handmaid has heard that wise rulers of old were
always accompanied by virtuous ministers, but never
that they drove out with women by their side.” She
was ultimately supplanted by a younger and more beautiful
rival, whereupon she forwarded to the Emperor
one of those fans, round or octagonal frames of bamboo
with silk stretched over them,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which in this country
are called “fire-screens,” inscribed with the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O fair white silk, fresh from the weaver’s loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as the frost, bright as the winter snow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! friendship fashions out of thee a fan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round as the round moon shines in heaven above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At home, abroad, a close companion thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirring at every move the grateful gale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I fear, ah me! that autumn chills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooling the dying summer’s torrid rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will see thee laid neglected on the shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thought of bygone days, like them bygone.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The phrase “autumn fan” has long since passed into
the language, and is used figuratively of a deserted wife.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

HISTORY&mdash;LEXICOGRAPHY</h3>


<div class="sidenote">SSŬ-MA CH’IEN</div>

<p>So far as China is concerned, the art of writing history
may be said to have been created during the period
under review. <span class="smcap">Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien</span>, the so-called Father of
History, was born about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 145. At the age of ten he
was already a good scholar, and at twenty set forth upon
a round of travel which carried him to all parts of the
empire. In <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 110 his father died, and he stepped
into the hereditary post of grand astrologer. After
devoting some time and energy to the reformation of
the calendar, he now took up the historical work which
had been begun by his father, and which was ultimately
given to the world as the Historical Record. It is a
history of China from the earliest ages down to about
one hundred years before the Christian era, in one
hundred and thirty chapters, arranged under five headings,
as follows:&mdash;(1) Annals of the Emperors; (2)
Chronological Tables; (3) Eight chapters on Rites, Music,
the Pitch-pipes, the Calendar, Astrology, Imperial Sacrifices,
Watercourses, and Political Economy; (4) Annals
of the Feudal Nobles; and (5) Biographies of many of
the eminent men of the period, which covers nearly three
thousand years. In such estimation is this work justly
held that its very words have been counted, and found
to number 526,500 in all. It must be borne in mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that these characters were, in all probability, scratched
with a stylus on bamboo tablets, and that previous to
this there was no such thing as a history on a general
and comprehensive plan; in fact, nothing beyond mere
local annals in the style of the Spring and Autumn.</p>

<p>Since the Historical Record, every dynasty has had its
historian, their works in all cases being formed upon the
model bequeathed by Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien. The Twenty-four
Dynastic Histories of China were produced in 1747 in a
uniform series bound up in 219 large volumes, and together
show a record such as can be produced by no
other country in the world.</p>

<p>The following are specimens of Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien’s
style:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) “When the House of Han arose, the evils of their
predecessors had not passed away. Husbands still went
off to the wars. The old and the young were employed
in transporting food. Production was almost at a standstill,
and money became scarce. So much so, that even
the Son of Heaven had not carriage-horses of the same
colour; the highest civil and military authorities rode in
bullock-carts, and the people at large knew not where
to lay their heads.</p>

<p>“At this epoch, the coinage in use was so heavy and
cumbersome that the people themselves started a new
issue at a fixed standard of value. But the laws were
too lax, and it was impossible to prevent grasping persons
from coining largely, buying largely, and then holding
against a rise in the market. The consequence was that
prices went up enormously. Rice sold at 10,000 <i>cash</i>
per picul; a horse cost 100 ounces of silver. But by
and by, when the empire was settling down to tranquillity,
his Majesty Kao Tsu gave orders that no trader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
should wear silk nor ride in a carriage; besides which,
the imposts levied upon this class were greatly increased,
in order to keep them down. Some years later these
restrictions were withdrawn; still, however, the descendants
of traders were disqualified from holding any office
connected with the State.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, certain levies were made on a scale calculated
to meet the exigencies of public expenditure;
while the land-tax and customs revenue were regarded
by all officials, from the Emperor downwards, as their
own personal emolument. Grain was forwarded by
water to the capital for the use of the officials there, but
the quantity did not amount to more than a few hundred
thousand piculs every year.</p>

<p>“Gradually the coinage began to deteriorate and light
coins to circulate; whereupon another issue followed,
each piece being marked ‘half an ounce.’ But at length
the system of private issues led to serious abuses, resulting
first of all in vast sums of money accumulating in
the hands of individuals; finally, in rebellion, until the
country was flooded with the coinage of the rebels,
and it became necessary to enact laws against any such
issues in the future.</p>

<p>“At this period the Huns were harassing our northern
frontier, and soldiers were massed there in large bodies;
in consequence of which food became so scarce that the
authorities offered certain rank and titles of honour to
those who would supply a given quantity of grain. Later
on, drought ensued in the west, and in order to meet
necessities of the moment, official rank was again made
a marketable commodity, while those who broke the laws
were allowed to commute their penalties by money payments.
And now horses began to reappear in official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
stables, and in palace and hall signs of an ampler luxury
were visible once more.</p>

<p>“Thus it was in the early days of the dynasty, until
some seventy years after the accession of the House of
Han. The empire was then at peace. For a long time
there had been neither flood nor drought, and a season
of plenty had ensued. The public granaries were well
stocked; the Government treasuries were full. In the
capital, strings of <i>cash</i> were piled in myriads, until the
very strings rotted, and their tale could no longer be
told. The grain in the Imperial storehouses grew mouldy
year by year. It burst from the crammed granaries, and
lay about until it became unfit for human food. The
streets were thronged with horses belonging to the
people, and on the highroads whole droves were to be
seen, so that it became necessary to prohibit the public
use of mares. Village elders ate meat and drank wine.
Petty government clerkships and the like lapsed from
father to son; the higher offices of State were treated
as family heirlooms. For there had gone abroad a
spirit of self-respect and of reverence for the law, while
a sense of charity and of duty towards one’s neighbour
kept men aloof from disgrace and shame.</p>

<p>“At length, under lax laws, the wealthy began to use
their riches for evil purposes of pride and self-aggrandisement
and oppression of the weak. Members of the
Imperial family received grants of land, while from the
highest to the lowest, every one vied with his neighbour
in lavishing money on houses, and appointments, and
apparel, altogether beyond the limit of his means. Such
is the everlasting law of the sequence of prosperity and
decay.</p>

<p>“Then followed extensive military preparations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
various parts of the empire; the establishment of a
tradal route with the barbarians of the south-west, for
which purpose mountains were hewn through for many
miles. The object was to open up the resources of
those remote districts, but the result was to swamp the
inhabitants in hopeless ruin. Then, again, there was
the subjugation of Korea; its transformation into an
Imperial dependency; with other troubles nearer home.
There was the ambush laid for the Huns, by which we
forfeited their alliance, and brought them down upon
our northern frontier. Nothing, in fact, but wars and
rumours of wars from day to day. Money was constantly
leaving the country. The financial stability of
the empire was undermined, and its impoverished people
were driven thereby into crime. Wealth had been
frittered away, and its renewal was sought in corruption.
Those who brought money in their hands received
appointments under government. Those who could pay
escaped the penalties of their guilt. Merit had to give
way to money. Shame and scruples of conscience were
laid aside. Laws and punishments were administered
with severer hand. From this period must be dated the
rise and growth of official venality.”</p>

<p>(2.) “The Odes have it thus:&mdash;‘We may gaze up to
the mountain’s brow: we may travel along the great
road;’ signifying that although we cannot hope to
reach the goal, still we may push on thitherwards in
spirit.</p>

<p>“While reading the works of Confucius, I have always
fancied I could see the man as he was in life; and when
I went to Shantung I actually beheld his carriage, his
robes, and the material parts of his ceremonial usages.
There were his descendants practising the old rites in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
their ancestral home, and I lingered on, unable to tear
myself away. Many are the princes and prophets that
the world has seen in its time, glorious in life, forgotten
in death. But Confucius, though only a humble member
of the cotton-clothed masses, remains among us after
many generations. He is the model for such as would
be wise. By all, from the Son of Heaven down to the
meanest student, the supremacy of his principles is fully
and freely admitted. He may indeed be pronounced
the divinest of men.”</p>

<p>(3.) “In the 9th moon the First Emperor was buried
in Mount Li, which in the early days of his reign he had
caused to be tunnelled and prepared with that view.
Then, when he had consolidated the empire, he employed
his soldiery, to the number of 700,000, to bore down to the
Three Springs (that is, until water was reached), and there
a foundation of bronze<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was laid and the sarcophagus
placed thereon. Rare objects and costly jewels were
collected from the palaces and from the various officials,
and were carried thither and stored in vast quantities.
Artificers were ordered to construct mechanical cross-bows,
which, if any one were to enter, would immediately
discharge their arrows. With the aid of quicksilver,
rivers were made, the Yang-tsze, the Hoang-ho, and the
great ocean, the metal being poured from one into the
other by machinery. On the roof were delineated the
constellations of the sky, on the floor the geographical
divisions of the earth. Candles were made from the fat
of the man-fish (walrus), calculated to last for a very
long time.</p>

<p>“The Second Emperor said, ‘It is not fitting that the
concubines of my late father who are without children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
should leave him now;’ and accordingly he ordered
them to accompany the dead monarch to the next world,
those who thus perished being many in number.</p>

<p>“When the interment was completed, some one suggested
that the workmen who had made the machinery
and concealed the treasure knew the great value of the
latter, and that the secret would leak out. Therefore, so
soon as the ceremony was over, and the path giving access
to the sarcophagus had been blocked up at its innermost
end, the outside gate at the entrance to this path was
let fall, and the mausoleum was effectually closed, so that
not one of the workmen escaped. Trees and grass were
then planted around, that the spot might look like the
rest of the mountain.”</p>

<p>The history by Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien stops about 100 years
before Christ. To carry it on from that point was the
ambition of a scholar named Pan Piao (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 3-54), but he
died while still collecting materials for his task. His
son, <span class="smcap">Pan Ku</span>, whose scholarship was extensive and profound,
took up the project, but was impeached on the
ground that he was altering the national records at his
own discretion, and was thrown into prison. Released
on the representations of a brother, he continued his
work; however, before its completion he became involved
in a political intrigue and was again thrown into
prison, where he died. The Emperor handed the unfinished
history to <span class="smcap">Pan Chao</span>, his gifted sister, who had
been all along his assistant, and by her it was brought
to completion down to about the Christian era, where
the occupancy of the throne by a usurper divides the
Han dynasty into two distinct periods. This lady was
also the author of a volume of moral advice to young
women, and of many poems and essays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HSÜ SHÊN</div>

<p>Lexicography, which has since been so widely cultivated
by the Chinese, was called into being by a famous
scholar named <span class="smcap">Hsü Shên</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 120). Entering upon
an official career, he soon retired and devoted the rest of
his life to books. He was a deep student of the Five
Classics, and wrote a work on the discrepancies in the
various criticisms of these books. But it is by his <cite>Shuo
Wên</cite> that he is now known. This was a collection, with
short explanatory notes, of all the characters&mdash;about ten
thousand&mdash;which were to be found in Chinese literature
as then existing, written in what is now known as the
Lesser Seal style. It is the oldest Chinese dictionary of
which we have any record, and has hitherto formed the
basis of all etymological research. It is arranged under
540 radicals or classifiers, that is to say, specially
selected portions of characters which indicate to some
extent the direction in which lies the sense of the whole
character, and its chief object was to exhibit the pictorial
features of Chinese writing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

BUDDHISM</h3>


<p>The introduction of Buddhism into China must now be
considered, especially under its literary aspect.</p>

<p>So early as <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 217 we read of Buddhist priests,
Shih-li-fang and others, coming to China. The “First
Emperor” seems to have looked upon them with suspicion.
At any rate, he threw them into prison, from
which, we are told, they were released in the night by
a golden man or angel. Nothing more was heard of
Buddhism until the Emperor known as Ming Ti, in consequence,
it is said, of a dream in which a foreign god
appeared to him, sent off a mission to India to see what
could be learnt upon the subject of this barbarian religion.
The mission, which consisted of eighteen persons,
returned about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 67, accompanied by two Indian
Buddhists named Kashiapmadanga and Gobharana.
These two settled at Lo-yang in Honan, which was then
the capital, and proceeded to translate into Chinese the
Sûtra of Forty-two Sections&mdash;the beginning of a long
line of such. Soon afterwards the former died, but the
seed had been sown, and a great rival to Taoism was
about to appear on the scene.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> another
Indian Buddhist, who had come to reside at Ch’ang-an
in Shensi, translated the <i>sûtra</i> known as the Lotus of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Good Law, and Buddhist temples were built in various
parts of China. By the beginning of the fourth century
Chinese novices were taking the vows required for the
Buddhist priesthood, and monasteries were endowed for
their reception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FA HSIEN</div>

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 399 <span class="smcap">Fa Hsien</span> started on his great pedestrian
journey from the heart of China overland to India, his
object being to procure copies of the Buddhist Canon,
statues, and relics. Those who accompanied him at
starting either turned back or died on the way, and he
finally reached India with only one companion, who
settled there and never returned to China. After visiting
various important centres, such as Magadha, Patna,
Benares, and Buddha-Gaya, and effecting the object of
his journey, he took passage on a merchant-ship, and
reached Ceylon. There he found a large junk which
carried him to Java, whence, after surviving many perils
of the sea, he made his way on board another junk to the
coast of Shantung, disembarking in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 414 with all his
treasures at the point now occupied by the German
settlement of Kiao-chow.</p>

<p>The narrative of his adventurous journey, as told by
himself, is still in existence, written in a crabbed and
difficult style. His itinerary has been traced, and nearly
all the places mentioned by him have been identified.
The following passage refers to the desert of Gobi, which
the travellers had to cross:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In this desert there are a great many evil spirits and
hot winds. Those who encounter the latter perish to
a man. There are neither birds above nor beasts below.
Gazing on all sides, as far as the eye can reach, in order
to mark the track, it would be impossible to succeed but
for the rotting bones of dead men which point the way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Buddha-Gaya, the scene of recent interesting explorations
conducted by the late General Cunningham, was
visited by Fa Hsien, and is described by him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The pilgrims now arrived at the city of Gaya, also a
complete waste within its walls. Journeying about three
more miles southwards, they reached the place where the
Bôdhisatva formerly passed six years in self-mortification.
It is very woody. From this point going west a mile,
they arrived at the spot where Buddha entered the water
to bathe, and a god pressed down the branch of a tree to
pull him out of the pool. Also, by going two-thirds of a
mile farther north, they reached the place where the two
lay-sisters presented Buddha with congee made with milk.
Two-thirds of a mile to the north of this is the place where
Buddha, sitting on a stone under a great tree and facing
the east, ate it. The tree and the stone are both there
still, the latter being about six feet in length and breadth
by over two feet in height. In Central India the climate
is equable; trees will live several thousand, and even so
much as ten thousand years. From this point going
north-east half a yojana, the pilgrims arrived at the cave
where the Bôdhisatva, having entered, sat down cross-legged
with his face to the west, and reflected as follows:
‘If I attain perfect wisdom, there should be some
miracle in token thereof.’ Whereupon the silhouette of
Buddha appeared upon the stone, over three feet in
length, and is plainly visible to this day. Then heaven
and earth quaked mightily, and the gods who were in
space cried out, saying, ‘This is not the place where
past and future Buddhas have attained and should attain
perfect wisdom. The proper spot is beneath the Bô
tree, less than half a yojana to the south-west of this.’
When the gods had uttered these words, they proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to lead the way with singing in order to conduct him
thither. The Bôdhisatva got up and followed, and when
thirty paces from the tree a god gave him the <i>kus’a</i> grass.
Having accepted this, he went on fifteen paces farther,
when five hundred dark-coloured birds came and flew
three times round him, and departed. The Bôdhisatva
went on to the Bô tree, and laying down his <i>kus’a</i> grass, sat
down with his face to the east. Then Mara, the king of
the devils, sent three beautiful women to approach from
the north and tempt him; he himself approaching from
the south with the same object. The Bôdhisatva pressed
the ground with his toes, whereupon the infernal army
retreated in confusion, and the three women became old.
At the above-mentioned place where Buddha suffered
mortification for six years, and on all these other spots,
men of after ages have built pagodas and set up images,
all of which are still in existence. Where Buddha, having
attained perfect wisdom, contemplated the tree for
seven days, experiencing the joys of emancipation;
where Buddha walked backwards and forwards, east and
west, under the Bô tree for seven days; where the gods
produced a jewelled chamber and worshipped Buddha
for seven days; where the blind dragon Muchilinda
enveloped Buddha for seven days; where Buddha sat
facing the east on a square stone beneath the nyagrodha
tree, and Brahmâ came to salute him; where the four
heavenly kings offered their alms-bowls; where the five
hundred traders gave him cooked rice and honey; where
he converted the brothers Kasyapa with their disciples to
the number of one thousand souls&mdash;on all these spots
stûpas have been raised.”</p>

<p>The following passage refers to Ceylon, called by
Fa Hsien the Land of the Lion, that is, Singhala, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the name of a trader who first founded a kingdom
there:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This country had originally no inhabitants; only
devils and spirits and dragons lived in it, with whom the
merchants of neighbouring countries came to trade.
When the exchange of commodities took place, the devils
and spirits did not appear in person, but set out their
valuables with the prices attached. Then the merchants,
according to the prices, bought the things and carried
them off. But from the merchants going backwards and
forwards and stopping on their way, the attractions of
the place became known to the inhabitants of the neighbouring
countries, who also went there, and thus it
became a great nation. The temperature is very agreeable
in this country; there is no distinction of summer
and winter. The trees and plants are always green, and
cultivation of the soil is carried on as men please,
without regard to seasons.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">KUMARAJIVA&mdash;HSÜAN TSANG</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indian Kumarajiva, one of the Four
Suns of Buddhism, had been occupied between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 405
and 412 in dictating Chinese commentaries on the Buddhist
Canon to some eight hundred priests. He also wrote
a <i>shâstra</i> on Reality and Appearance, and translated the
Diamond Sûtra, which has done more to popularise
Buddhism with the educated classes than all the material
parts of this religion put together. Chinese poets and
philosophers have drawn inspiration and instruction
from its pages, and the work might now almost be
classed as a national classic. Here are two short
extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) “Buddha said, O Subhūti, tell me after thy wit, can
a man see the Buddha in the flesh?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“He cannot, O World-Honoured, and for this reason:
The Buddha has declared that flesh has no objective
existence.</p>

<p>“Then Buddha told Subhūti, saying, All objective
existences are unsubstantial and unreal. If a man can
see clearly that they are so, then can he see the
Buddha.”</p>

<p>(2.) “Buddha said, O Subhūti, if one man were to collect
the seven precious things from countless galaxies of
worlds, and bestow all these in charity, and another
virtuous man, or virtuous woman, were to become
filled with the spirit, and held fast by this <i>sûtra</i>, preaching
it ever so little for the conversion of mankind, I
say unto you that the happiness of this last man would
far exceed the happiness of that other man.</p>

<p>“Conversion to what? To the disregard of objective
existences, and to absolute quiescence of the individual.
And why? Because every external phenomenon is like
a dream, like a vision, like a bubble, like shadow, like
dew, like lightning, and should be regarded as such.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 520 Bôdhidharma came to China, and was
received with honour. He had been the son of a king
in Southern India. He taught that religion was not
to be learnt from books, but that man should seek and
find the Buddha in his own heart. Just before his
arrival Sung Yün had been sent to India to obtain
more Buddhist books, and had remained two years in
Kandahar, returning with 175 volumes.</p>

<p>Then, in 629, <span class="smcap">Hsüan Tsang</span> set out for India with
the same object, and also to visit the holy places of
Buddhism. He came back in 645, bringing with him
657 Buddhist books, besides many images and pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and 150 relics. He spent the rest of his life translating
these books, and also, like Fa Hsien, wrote a narrative
of his travels.</p>

<p>This brings us down to the beginning of the T’ang
dynasty, when Buddhism had acquired, in spite of much
opposition and even persecution, what has since proved
to be a lasting hold upon the masses of the Chinese
people.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

POETRY&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE</h3>


<p>The centuries which elapsed between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 200 and 600
were not favourable to the development and growth
of a national literature. During a great part of the
time the empire was torn by civil wars; there was
not much leisure for book-learning, and few patrons
to encourage it. Still the work was carried on, and
many great names have come down to us.</p>

<p>The dark years between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 196 and 221, which
witnessed the downfall of the House of Han, were illumined
by the names of seven writers, now jointly known
as the Seven Scholars of the Chien-An period. They
were all poets. There was <span class="smcap">Hsü Kan</span>, who fell under
the influence of Buddhism and translated into Chinese
the <i>Pranyamûla shâstra tikâ</i> of Nâgârdjuna. The following
lines are by him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O floating clouds that swim in heaven above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear on your wings these words to him I love...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! you float along nor heed my pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me here to love and long in vain!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I see other dear ones to their homes return,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since my lord left&mdash;ah me, unhappy day!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mirror’s dust has not been brushed away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart, like running water, knows no peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bleeds and bleeds forever without cease.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">K’UNG JUNG&mdash;WANG TS’AN</div>

<p>There was <span class="smcap">K’ung Jung</span>, a descendant of Confucius
in the twentieth degree, and a most precocious child.
At ten years of age he went with his father to Lo-yang,
where Li Ying, the Dragon statesman, was at the height
of his political reputation. Unable from the press of
visitors to gain admission, he told the doorkeeper to
inform Li Ying that he was a connection, and thus
succeeded in getting in. When Li Ying asked him
what the connection was, he replied, “My ancestor Confucius
and your ancestor Lao Tzŭ were friends engaged
in the quest for truth, so that you and I may
be said to be of the same family.” Li Ying was
astonished, but Ch’ên Wei said, “Cleverness in youth
does not mean brilliancy in later life,” upon which
K’ung Jung remarked, “You, sir, must evidently have
been very clever as a boy.” Entering official life,
he rose to be Governor of Po-hai in Shantung; but
he incurred the displeasure of the great Ts’ao Ts’ao,
and was put to death with all his family. He was
an open-hearted man, and fond of good company.
“If my halls are full of guests,” he would say, “and
my bottles full of wine, I am happy.”</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of his poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The wanderer reaches home with joy<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Life’s dread uncertainty he knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But oh for this untimely close!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was <span class="smcap">Wang Ts’an</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 177-217), a learned man
who wrote an <i>Ars Poetica</i>, not, however, in verse. A youth
of great promise, he excelled as a poet, although the
times were most unfavourable to success. It has been
alleged, with more or less truth, that all Chinese poetry
is pitched in the key of melancholy; that the favourite
themes of Chinese poets are the transitory character of
life with its partings and other ills, and the inevitable approach
of death, with substitution of the unknown for the
known. Wang Ts’an had good cause for his lamentations.
He was forced by political disturbances to leave his home
at the capital and seek safety in flight. There, as he
tells us,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Wolves and tigers work their own sweet will.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the way he finds</p>

<p>and he comes across a famine-stricken woman who had
thrown among the bushes a child she was unable to feed.
Arriving at the Great River, the setting sun brings his
feelings to a head:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">While a deeper shade falls upon the steep slopes;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clear sound the ripples of the rushing waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the banks the gibbons scream and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sleeves are fluttered by the whistling gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lapels of my robe are drenched with dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The livelong night I cannot close my eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I arise and seize my guitar,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>By the last line he means to hint “how much a long
communion tends to make us what we are.”</p>

<p>There was <span class="smcap">Ying Yang</span>, who, when his own political
career was cut short, wrote a poem with a title which
may be interpreted as “Regret that a Bucephalus should
stand idle.”</p>

<p>There was <span class="smcap">Liu Chêng</span>, who was put to death for daring
to cast an eye upon one of the favourites of the great
general Ts’ao Ts’ao, virtual founder of the House of Wei.
<span class="smcap">Ch’ên Lin</span> and <span class="smcap">Yüan Yü</span> complete the tale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TS’AO TS’AO</div>

<p>To these seven names an eighth and a ninth are added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
by courtesy: those of <span class="smcap">Ts’ao Ts’ao</span> above mentioned, and
of his third son, Ts’ao Chih, the poet. The former played a
remarkable part in Chinese history. His father had been
adopted as son by the chief eunuch of the palace, and he
himself was a wild young man much given to coursing
and hawking. He managed, however, to graduate at
the age of twenty, and, after distinguishing himself in a
campaign against insurgents, raised a volunteer force to
purge the country of various powerful chieftains who
threatened the integrity of the empire. By degrees the
supreme power passed into his hands, and he caused the
weak Emperor to raise his daughter to the rank of
Empress. He is popularly regarded as the type of a
bold bad Minister and of a cunning unscrupulous rebel.
His large armies are proverbial, and at one time he is
said to have had so many as a million of men under arms.
As an instance of the discipline which prevailed in his
camp, it is said that he once condemned himself to death
for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of grain,
in accordance with his own severe regulations against
any injury to standing crops. However, in lieu of losing
his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice
by cutting off his hair. The following lines are from a
song by him, written in an abrupt metre of four words
to the line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here is wine, let us sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man’s life is short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its best days gone by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though we would rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrows are hard to forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will make us forget them?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wine, and only wine.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After Ts’ao Ts’ao’s death came the epoch of the Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Kingdoms, the romantic story of which is told in the
famous novel to be mentioned later on. Ts’ao Ts’ao’s
eldest son became the first Emperor of one of these, the
Wei Kingdom, and <span class="smcap">Ts’ao Chih</span>, the poet, occupied an
awkward position at court, an object of suspicion and
dislike. At ten years of age he already excelled in composition,
so much so that his father thought he must be
a plagiarist; but he settled the question by producing
off-hand poems on any given theme. “If all the talent
of the world,” said a contemporary poet, “were represented
by ten, Ts’ao Chih would have eight, I should have
one, and the rest of mankind one between them.” There
is a story that on one occasion, at the bidding of his
elder brother, probably with mischievous intent, he
composed an impromptu stanza while walking only
seven steps. It has been remembered more for its point
than its poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A fine dish of beans had been placed in the pot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a view to a good mess of pottage all hot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beanstalks, aflame, a fierce heat were begetting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beans in the pot were all fuming and fretting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the beans and the stalks were not born to be foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, why should these hurry to finish off those?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following extract from a poem of his contains a
very well-known maxim, constantly in use at the present
day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The superior man takes precautions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And avoids giving cause for suspicion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will not pull up his shoes in a melon-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor under a plum-tree straighten his hat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers- and sisters-in-law may not join hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elders and youngers may not walk abreast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By toil and humility the handle is grasped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moderate your brilliancy, and difficulties disappear.”<br /></span>

<div class="sidenote">LIU LING</div>

<p>During the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> another and more mercurial
set of poets, also seven in number, formed themselves
into a club, and became widely famous as the
Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Among these was
<span class="smcap">Liu Ling</span>, a hard drinker, who declared that to a drunken
man “the affairs of this world appear but as so much
duckweed on a river.” He wished to be always accompanied
by a servant with wine, followed by another with
a spade, so that he might be buried where he fell. On
one occasion, yielding to the entreaties of his wife, he
promised to “swear off,” and bade her prepare the usual
sacrifices of wine and meat. When all was ready, he
prayed, saying, “O God, who didst give to Liu Ling a
reputation through wine, he being able to consume a
gallon at a sitting and requiring a quart to sober him
again, listen not to the words of his wife, for she speaketh
not truth.” Thereupon he drank up the sacrificial wine,
and was soon as drunk as ever. His bias was towards
the Tao of Lao Tzŭ, and he was actually plucked for his
degree in consequence of an essay extolling the heterodox
doctrine of Inaction. The following skit exhibits
this Taoist strain to a marked degree:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An old gentleman, a friend of mine (that is, himself),
regards eternity as but a single day, and whole centuries
as but an instant of time. The sun and moon are the
windows of his house; the cardinal points are the
boundaries of his domain. He wanders unrestrained
and free; he dwells within no walls. The canopy of
heaven is his roof; his resting-place is the lap of earth.
He follows his fancy in all things. He is never for a
moment without a wine-flask in one hand, a goblet in
the other. His only thought is wine: he knows of
naught beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Two respectable philanthropists, hearing of my
friend’s weakness, proceeded to tax him on the subject;
and with many gestures of disapprobation, fierce scowls,
and gnashing of teeth, preached him quite a sermon on
the rules of propriety, and sent his faults buzzing round
his head like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>“When they began, the old gentleman filled himself
another bumper; and sitting down, quietly stroked his
beard and sipped his wine by turns, until at length he
lapsed into a semi-inebriate state of placid enjoyment,
varied by intervals of absolute unconsciousness or of
partial return to mental lucidity. His ears were beyond
the reach of thunder; he could not have seen a mountain.
Heat and cold existed for him no more. He knew
not even the workings of his own mind. To him, the
affairs of this world appeared but as so much duckweed
on a river; while the two philanthropists at his side
looked like two wasps trying to convert a caterpillar”
(into a wasp, as the Chinese believe is done).</p>

<p>Another was <span class="smcap">Hsi K’ang</span>, a handsome young man,
seven feet seven inches in height, who was married&mdash;a
doubtful boon&mdash;into the Imperial family. His favourite
study was alchemistic research, and he passed his days
sitting under a willow-tree in his courtyard and experimenting
in the transmutation of metals, varying his toil
with music and poetry, and practising the art of breathing
with a view to securing immortality. Happening,
however, to offend by his want of ceremony one of the
Imperial princes, who was also a student of alchemy, he
was denounced to the Emperor as a dangerous person
and a traitor, and condemned to death. Three thousand
disciples offered each one to take the place of their
beloved master, but their request was not granted. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
met his fate with fortitude, calmly watching the shadows
thrown by the sun and playing upon his lute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HSIANG HSIU&mdash;YÜAN CHI</div>

<p>The third was <span class="smcap">Hsiang Hsiu</span>, who also tried his hand
at alchemy, and whose commentary on Chuang Tzŭ was
stolen, as has been already stated, by Kuo Hsiang.</p>

<p>The fourth was <span class="smcap">Yüan Hsien</span>, a wild harum-scarum
fellow, but a performer on the guitar and a great authority
on the theory of music. He and his uncle, both
poverty-stricken, lived on one side of the road, while a
wealthier branch of the family lived on the other side.
On the seventh of the seventh moon the latter put out all
their grand fur robes and fine clothes to air, as is customary
on that day; whereupon Yüan Hsien on his side
forked up a pair of the short breeches, called calf-nose
drawers, worn by the common coolies, explaining to a
friend that he was a victim to the tyranny of custom.</p>

<p>The fifth was <span class="smcap">Yüan Chi</span>, another musician, whose harpsichords
became the “Strads” of China. He entered the
army and rose to a high command, and then exchanged
his post for one where he had heard there was a better
cook. He was a model of filial piety, and when his
mother died he wept so violently that he brought up
several pints of blood. Yet when Chi Hsi went to condole
with him, he showed only the whites of his eyes (that
is, paid no attention to him); while Chi Hsi’s brother, who
carried along with him a jar of wine and a guitar, was
welcomed with the pupils. His best-known work is a
political and allegorical poem in thirty-eight stanzas
averaging about twelve lines to each. The allusions in
this are so skilfully veiled as to be quite unrecognisable
without a commentary, such concealment being absolutely
necessary for the protection of the author in the
troublous times during which he wrote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixth was <span class="smcap">Wang Jung</span>, who could look at the sun
without being dazzled, and lastly there was <span class="smcap">Shan T’ao</span>,
a follower of Taoist teachings, who was spoken of as
“uncut jade” and as “gold ore.”</p>

<p>Later on, in the fourth century, comes <span class="smcap">Fu Mi</span>, of
whom nothing is known beyond his verses, of which the
following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thy chariot and horses<br /></span>
<span class="i16">have gone, and I fret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long for the lover<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We now reach a name which is still familiar to all
students of poetry in the Middle Kingdom. <span class="smcap">T’ao Ch’ien</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 365-427), or T’ao Yüan-ming as he was called in
early life, after a youth of poverty obtained an appointment
as magistrate. But he was unfitted by nature for
official life; all he wanted, to quote his own prayer, was
“length of years and depth of wine.” He only held the
post for eighty-three days, objecting to receive a superior
officer with the usual ceremonial on the ground that “he
could not crook the hinges of his back for five pecks of
rice a day,” such being the regulation pay of a magistrate.
He then retired into private life and occupied
himself with poetry, music, and the culture of flowers,
especially chrysanthemums, which are inseparably asso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ciated
with his name. In the latter pursuit he was
seconded by his wife, who worked in the back garden
while he worked in the front. His retirement from
office is the subject of the following piece, of the
poetical-prose class, which, in point of style, is considered
one of the masterpieces of the language:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Homewards I bend my steps. My fields, my gardens,
are choked with weeds: should I not go? My soul has
led a bondsman’s life: why should I remain to pine? But
I will waste no grief upon the past; I will devote my
energies to the future. I have not wandered far astray.
I feel that I am on the right track once again.</p>

<p>“Lightly, lightly, speeds my boat along, my garments
fluttering to the gentle breeze. I inquire my route as I go.
I grudge the slowness of the dawning day. From afar
I descry my old home, and joyfully press onwards in my
haste. The servants rush forth to meet me; my children
cluster at the gate. The place is a wilderness; but there
is the old pine-tree and my chrysanthemums. I take
the little ones by the hand, and pass in. Wine is brought
in full jars, and I pour out in brimming cups. I gaze
out at my favourite branches. I loll against the window
in my new-found freedom. I look at the sweet children
on my knee.</p>

<p>“And now I take my pleasure in my garden. There
is a gate, but it is rarely opened. I lean on my staff as
I wander about or sit down to rest. I raise my head
and contemplate the lovely scene. Clouds rise, unwilling,
from the bottom of the hills; the weary bird seeks its
nest again. Shadows vanish, but still I linger around my
lonely pine. Home once more! I’ll have no friendships
to distract me hence. The times are out of joint
for me; and what have I to seek from men? In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pure enjoyment of the family circle I will pass my days,
cheering my idle hours with lute and book. My husbandmen
will tell me when spring-time is nigh, and when
there will be work in the furrowed fields. Thither I
shall repair by cart or by boat, through the deep gorge,
over the dizzy cliff, trees bursting merrily into leaf, the
streamlet swelling from its tiny source. Glad is this
renewal of life in due season; but for me, I rejoice that
my journey is over. Ah, how short a time it is that we
are here! Why then not set our hearts at rest, ceasing
to trouble whether we remain or go? What boots it to
wear out the soul with anxious thoughts? I want not
wealth; I want not power; heaven is beyond my hopes.
Then let me stroll through the bright hours as they pass,
in my garden among my flowers; or I will mount the
hill and sing my song, or weave my verse beside the
limpid brook. Thus will I work out my allotted span,
content with the appointments of Fate, my spirit free
from care.”</p>

<p>The “Peach-blossom Fountain” of Tao Ch’ien is a
well-known and charming allegory, a form of literature
much cultivated by Chinese writers. It tells how a fisherman
lost his way among the creeks of a river, and came
upon a dense and lovely grove of peach-trees in full
bloom, through which he pushed his boat, anxious to
see how far the grove extended.</p>

<p>“He found that the peach-trees ended where the
water began, at the foot of a hill; and there he espied
what seemed to be a cave with light issuing from it.
So he made fast his boat, and crept in through a narrow
entrance, which shortly ushered him into a new world
of level country, of fine houses, of rich fields, of fine
pools, and of luxuriance of mulberry and bamboo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Highways of traffic ran north and south; sounds of
crowing cocks and barking dogs were heard around;
the dress of the people who passed along or were
at work in the fields was of a strange cut; while
young and old alike appeared to be contented and
happy.”</p>

<p>He is told that the ancestors of these people had
taken refuge there some five centuries before to escape
the troublous days of the “First Emperor,” and that
there they had remained, cut off completely from the
rest of the human race. On his returning home the story
is noised abroad, and the Governor sends out men to
find this strange region, but the fisherman is never
able to find it again. The gods had permitted the poet
to go back for a brief span to the peach-blossom days
of his youth.</p>

<p>One critic speaks of T’ao Ch’ien as “drunk with the
fumes of spring.” Another says, “His heart was fixed
upon loyalty and duty, while his body was content with
leisure and repose. His emotions were real, his scenery
was real, his facts were real, and his thoughts were
real. His workmanship was so exceedingly fine as to
appear natural; his adze and chisel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labor limae</i>) left no
traces behind.”</p>

<p>Much of his poetry is political, and bristles with
allusions to events which are now forgotten, mixed up
with thoughts and phrases which are greatly admired
by his countrymen. Thus, when he describes meeting
with an old friend in a far-off land, such a passage as
this would be heavily scored by editor or critic with
marks of commendation:&mdash;</p>

<p>The original name of a striking character who, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
502, placed himself upon the throne as first Emperor of
the Liang dynasty, was <span class="smcap">Hsiao Yen</span>. He was a devout
Buddhist, living upon priestly fare and taking only one
meal a day; and on two occasions, in 527 and 529, he
actually adopted the priestly garb. He also wrote a
Buddhist ritual in ten books. Interpreting the Buddhist
commandment “Thou shalt not kill” in its strictest
sense, he caused the sacrificial victims to be made of
dough. The following short poem is from his pen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Trees grow, not alike,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">by the mound and the moat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birds sing in the forest<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The mountains rise high<br /></span>
<span class="i12">and the waters sink low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the why and the wherefore<br /></span>
<span class="i12">we never can know.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another well-known poet who lived into the seventh
century is <span class="smcap">Hsieh Tao-hêng</span>. He offended Yang Ti, the
second Emperor of the Sui dynasty, by writing better
verses than his Majesty, and an excuse was found for
putting him to death. One of the most admired couplets
in the language is associated with his name though
not actually by him, its author being unknown. To
amuse a party of friends Hsieh Tao-hêng had written
impromptu,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A week in the spring to the exile appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an absence from home of a couple of years.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>A “southerner” who was present sneered at the shallowness
of the conceit, and immediately wrote down the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“If home, with the wild geese of autumn,<br /></span>
<span class="i32">we’re going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts will be off ere the spring flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i32">are blowing.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An official of the Sui dynasty was <span class="smcap">Fu I</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 554-639),
who became Historiographer under the first Emperor of
the T’ang dynasty. He had a strong leaning towards
Taoism, and edited the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. At the same time
he presented a memorial asking that the Buddhist
religion might be abolished; and when Hsiao Yü, a
descendant of Hsiao Yen (above), questioned him on the
subject, he said, “You were not born in a hollow mulberry-tree;
yet you respect a religion which does not
recognise the tie between father and son!” He urged
that at any rate priests and nuns should be compelled to
marry and bring up families, and not escape from contributing
their share to the revenue, adding that Hsiao
Yü by defending their doctrines showed himself no better
than they were. At this Hsiao Yü held up his hands,
and declared that hell was made for such men as Fu I.
The result was that severe restrictions were placed for
a short time upon the teachers of Buddhism. The
Emperor T’ai Tsung once got hold of a Tartar priest
who could “charm people into unconsciousness, and
then charm them back to life again,” and spoke of his
powers to Fu I. The latter said confidently, “He will
not be able to charm me;” and when put to the test,
the priest completely failed. He was the originator of
epitaphs, and wrote his own, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i12">Alas! he died of drink.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">WANG CHI</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wang Chi</span> of the sixth and seventh centuries <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, was
a wild and unconventional spirit, with a fatal fondness
for wine, which caused his dismissal from office. His
capacity for liquor was boundless, and he was known as
the Five-bottle Scholar. In his lucid intervals he wrote
much beautiful prose and verse, which may still be read
with pleasure. The following is from an account of his
visit to Drunk-Land, the story of which is told with all due
gravity and in a style modelled upon that which is found
in ordinary accounts of strange outlandish nations:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This country is many thousand miles from the
Middle Kingdom. It is a vast, boundless plain, without
mountains or undulations of any kind. The climate is
equable, there being neither night, nor day, nor cold, nor
heat. The manners and customs are everywhere the
same.</p>

<p>“There are no villages nor congregations of persons.
The inhabitants are ethereal in disposition, and know
neither love, hate, joy, nor anger. They inhale the
breeze and sip the dew, eating none of the five cereals.
Calm in repose, slow of gait, they mingle with birds,
beasts, fishes, and scaly creatures, ignorant of boats,
chariots, weapons, or implements in general.</p>

<p>“The Yellow Emperor went on a visit to the capital of
Drunk-Land, and when he came back, he was quite out
of conceit with the empire, the government of which
seemed to him but paltry trifling with knotted cords.</p>

<p>“Yüan Chi, T’ao Ch’ien,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and some others, about ten
in all, made a trip together to Drunk-Land, and sank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
never to rise again. They were buried where they fell,
and now in the Middle Kingdom they are dubbed Spirits
of Wine.</p>

<p>“Alas, I could not bear that the pure and peaceful
domain of Drunk-Land should come to be regarded as a
preserve of the ancients. So I went there myself.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The period closes with the name of the Emperor
known as Yang Ti, already mentioned in connection
with the poet Hsieh Tao-hêng. The murderer,
first of his elder brother and then of his father, he
mounted the throne in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 605, and gave himself up to
extravagance and debauchery. The trees in his park
were supplied in winter with silken leaves and flowers,
and birds were almost exterminated to provide a sufficient
supply of down for his cushions. After reigning
for thirteen years this unlikely patron of literature fell a
victim to assassination. Yet in spite of his otherwise
disreputable character, Yang Ti prided himself upon his
literary attainments. He set one hundred scholars to
work editing a collection of classical, medical, and other
treatises; and it was under his reign, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 606, that
the examination for the second or “master of arts”
degree was instituted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

CLASSICAL SCHOLARSHIP</h3>


<p>In the domains of classical and general literature <span class="smcap">Huang-fu Mi</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 215-282) occupies an honourable place.
Beginning life at the ploughtail, by perseverance he
became a fine scholar, and adopted literature as a profession.
In spite of severe rheumatism he was never
without a book in his hand, and became so absorbed
in his work that he would forget all about meals and
bedtime. He was called the Book-Debauchee, and once
when he wished to borrow works from the Emperor
Wu Ti of the Chin dynasty, whose proffers of office he
had refused, his Majesty sent him back a cart-load to
go on with. He produced essays, poetry, and several
important biographical works. His work on the Spring
and Autumn Annals had also considerable vogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sun Shu-Jan</span>, of about the same date, distinguished
himself by his works on the Confucian Canon, and wrote
on the <cite>Erh Ya</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hsün Hsü</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 289) aided in drawing up a Penal
Code for the newly-established Chin dynasty, took a
leading part in editing the Bamboo Annals, which had
just been discovered in Honan, provided a preface to
the <cite>Mu T’ien Tzŭ Chuan</cite>, and also wrote on music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kuo Hsiang</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 312) occupied himself chiefly
with the philosophy of Lao Tzŭ and with the writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of Chuang Tzŭ. It was said of him that his conversation
was like the continuous downflow of a rapid, or
the rush of water from a sluice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kuo P’o</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 324) was a scholar of great repute.
Besides editing various important classical works, he
was a brilliant exponent of the doctrines of Taoism and
the reputed founder of the art of geomancy as applied
to graves, universally practised in China at the present
day. He was also learned in astronomy, divination, and
natural philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fan Yeh</span>, executed for treason in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 445, is chiefly
famous for his history of the Han dynasty from about
the date of the Christian era, when the dynasty was
interrupted, as has been stated, by a usurper, down
to the final collapse two hundred years later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shên Yo</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 441-513), another famous scholar, was
the son of a Governor of Huai-nan, whose execution in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 453 caused him to go for a time into hiding. Poor
and studious, he is said to have spent the night in
repeating what he had learnt by day, as his mother,
anxious on account of his health, limited his supply
of oil and fuel. Entering official life, he rose to
high office, from which he retired in ill-health, loaded
with honours. Personally, he was remarkable for having
two pupils to his left eye. He was a strict teetotaller,
and lived most austerely. He had a library
of twenty thousand volumes. He was the author of
the histories of the Chin, Liu Sung, and Ch’i dynasties.
He is said to have been the first to classify the four
tones. In his autobiography he writes, “The poets of
old, during the past thousand years, never hit upon
this plan. I alone discovered its advantages.” The
Emperor Wu Ti of the Liang dynasty one day said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
him, “Come, tell me, what are these famous four
tones?” “They are whatever your Majesty pleases to
make them,” replied Shên Yo, skilfully selecting for
his answer four characters which illustrated, and in
the usual order, the four tones in question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HSIAO T’UNG</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hsiao T’ung</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 501-531) was the eldest son of
Hsiao Yen, the founder of the Liang dynasty, whom
he predeceased. Before he was five years old he was
reported to have learned the Classics by heart, and
his later years were marked by great literary ability,
notably in verse-making. Handsome and of charming
manners, mild and forbearing, he was universally loved.
In 527 he nursed his mother through her last illness,
and his grief for her death impaired his naturally fine
constitution, for it was only at the earnest solicitation
of his father that he consented either to eat or drink
during the period of mourning. Learned men were sure
of his patronage, and his palace contained a large library.
A lover of nature, he delighted to ramble with scholars
about his beautiful park, to which he declined to add
the attraction of singing-girls. When the price of grain
rose in consequence of the war with Wei in 526, he lived
on the most frugal fare; and throughout his life his
charities were very large and kept secret, being distributed
by trusty attendants who sought out all cases
of distress. He even emptied his own wardrobe for
the benefit of the poor, and spent large sums in burying
the outcast dead. Against forced labour on public
works he vehemently protested. To his father he was
most respectful, and wrote to him when he himself was
almost at the last gasp, in the hope of concealing his
danger. But he is remembered now not so much for
his virtues as for his initiation of a new department in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
literature. A year before his death he completed the
<cite>Wên Hsüan</cite>, the first published collection of choice works,
whole or in part, of a large number of authors. These
were classified under such heads as poetry of various
kinds, essays, inscriptions, memorials, funeral orations,
epitaphs, and prefaces.</p>

<p>The idea thus started was rapidly developed, and
has been continued down to modern times. Huge collections
of works have from time to time been reprinted
in uniform editions, and many books which might
otherwise have perished have been preserved for grateful
posterity. The Record of the Buddhistic Kingdoms
by Fa Hsien may be quoted as an example.</p>

<h2>BOOK THE FOURTH<br />

<span class="smaller"><i>THE T’ANG DYNASTY</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600-900)</span></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

POETRY</h3>


<div class="sidenote">POETRY</div>

<p>The T’ang dynasty is usually associated in Chinese
minds with much romance of love and war, with wealth,
culture, and refinement, with frivolity, extravagance, and
dissipation, but most of all with poetry. China’s best
efforts in this direction were chiefly produced within the
limits of its three hundred years’ duration, and they have
been carefully preserved as finished models for future
poets of all generations.</p>

<p>“Poetry,” says a modern Chinese critic, “came into
being with the Odes, developed with the <cite>Li Sao</cite>,
burst forth and reached perfection under the T’angs.
Some good work was indeed done under the Han and
Wei dynasties; the writers of those days seemed to have
material in abundance, but language inadequate to its
expression.”</p>

<p>The “Complete Collection of the Poetry of the T’ang
Dynasty,” published in 1707, contains 48,900 poems of
all kinds, arranged in 900 books, and filling thirty good-sized
volumes. Some Chinese writers divide the dynasty
into three poetical periods, called Early, Glorious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Late; and they profess to detect in the works assigned
to each the corresponding characteristics of growth,
fulness, and decay. Others insert a Middle period between
the last two, making four periods in all. For
general purposes, however, it is only necessary to state,
that since the age of the Hans the meanings of words
had gradually come to be more definitely fixed, and the
structural arrangement more uniform and more polished.
Imagination began to come more freely into play, and
the language to flow more easily and more musically,
as though responsive to the demands of art. A Chinese
poem is at best a hard nut to crack, expressed as it
usually is in lines of five or seven monosyllabic root-ideas,
without inflection, agglutination, or grammatical
indication of any kind, the connection between which
has to be inferred by the reader from the logic,
from the context, and least perhaps of all from the
syntactical arrangement of the words. Then, again,
the poet is hampered not only by rhyme but also by
tone. For purposes of poetry the characters in the
Chinese language are all ranged under two tones, as
<i>flats</i> and <i>sharps</i>, and these occupy fixed positions just
as dactyls, spondees, trochees, and anapæsts in the construction
of Latin verse. As a consequence, the natural
order of words is often entirely sacrificed to the exigencies
of tone, thus making it more difficult than ever for
the reader to grasp the sense. In a stanza of the ordinary
five-character length the following tonal arrangement
would appear:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Sharp  sharp  flat  flat  sharp<br />
Flat      flat   sharp sharp flat<br />
Flat      flat   flat  sharp sharp<br />
Sharp     sharp  sharp flat  flat.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect produced by these tones is very marked and
pleasing to the ear, and often makes up for the faultiness
of the rhymes, which are simply the rhymes of the
Odes as heard 2500 years ago, many of them of course
being no longer rhymes at all. Thus, there is as much
artificiality about a stanza of Chinese verse as there
is about an Alcaic stanza in Latin. But in the hands
of the most gifted this artificiality is altogether concealed
by art, and the very trammels of tone and rhyme become
transfigured, and seem to be necessary aids and adjuncts
to success. Many works have been published to guide
the student in his admittedly difficult task. The first
rule in one of these seems so comprehensive as to make
further perusal quite unnecessary. It runs thus:&mdash;“Discard
commonplace form; discard commonplace
ideas; discard commonplace phrasing; discard commonplace
words; discard commonplace rhymes.”</p>

<p>A long poem does not appeal to the Chinese mind.
There is no such thing as an epic in the language,
though, of course, there are many pieces extending to
several hundred lines. Brevity is indeed the soul of
a Chinese poem, which is valued not so much for what
it says as for what it suggests. As in painting, so in
poetry suggestion is the end and aim of the artist, who
in each case may be styled an impressionist. The ideal
length is twelve lines, and this is the limit set to candidates
at the great public examinations at the present
day, the Chinese holding that if a poet cannot say
within such compass what he has to say it may very
well be left unsaid. The eight-line poem is also a
favourite, and so, but for its extreme difficulty, is the
four-line epigram, or “stop-short,” so called because
of its abruptness, though, as the critics explain, “it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
only the words which stop, the sense goes on,” some
train of thought having been suggested to the reader.
The latter form of verse was in use so far back as the
Han dynasty, but only reached perfection under the
Tangs. Although consisting of only twenty or twenty-eight
words, according to the measure employed, it is
just long enough for the poet to introduce, to develop,
to embellish, and to conclude his theme in accordance
with certain established laws of composition. The third
line is considered the most troublesome to produce,
some poets even writing it first; the last line should
contain a “surprise” or <i>dénouement</i>. We are, in fact,
reminded of the old formula, “Omne epigramma sit
instar apis,” &amp;c., better known in its English dress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The qualities rare in a bee that we meet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In an epigram never should fail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body should always be little and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a sting should be left in the tail.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following is an early specimen, by an anonymous
writer, of the four-line poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The bright moon shining overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stream beneath the breeze’s touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are pure and perfect joys indeed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But few are they who think them such.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Turning now to the almost endless list of poets from
which but a scanty selection can be made, we may
begin with <span class="smcap">Wang Po</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 648-676), a precocious boy
who wrote verses when he was six. He took his degree
at sixteen, and was employed in the Historical Department,
but was dismissed for satirising the cock-fighting
propensities of the Imperial princes. He filled up his
leisure by composing many beautiful poems. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
meditated on these beforehand, but after having prepared
a quantity of ink ready for use, he would drink
himself tipsy and lie down with his face covered up.
On waking he would seize his pen and write off verses,
not a word in which needed to be changed; whence
he acquired the sobriquet of Belly-Draft, meaning that
his drafts, or rough copies, were all prepared inside.
And he received so many presents of valuable silks for
writing these odes, that it was said “he spun with his
mind.” These lines are from his pen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Near these islands a palace<br /></span>
<span class="i10">was built by a prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But its music and song<br /></span>
<span class="i10">have departed long since;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hill-mists of morning<br /></span>
<span class="i10">sweep down on the halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night the red curtains<br /></span>
<span class="i10">lie furled on the walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds o’er the water<br /></span>
<span class="i10">their shadows still cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things change like the stars:<br /></span>
<span class="i10">how few autumns have passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet where is that prince?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">where is he?&mdash;No reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the plash of the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i10">rolling ceaselessly by.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">CH’ÊN TZŬ-ANG</div>

<p>A still more famous contemporary of his was <span class="smcap">Ch’ên
Tzŭ-ang</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 656-698), who adopted somewhat sensational
means of bringing himself to the notice of the
public. He purchased a very expensive guitar which
had been for a long time on sale, and then let it be
known that on the following day he would perform
upon it in public. This attracted a large crowd; but
when Ch’ên arrived he informed his auditors that he had
something in his pocket worth much more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
guitar. Thereupon he dashed the instrument into a
thousand pieces, and forthwith began handing round
copies of his own writings. Here is a sample, directed
against the Buddhist worship of idols, the “Prophet”
representing any divinely-inspired teacher of the Confucian
school:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“On Self the Prophet never rests his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His to relieve the doom of humankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairy palaces beyond the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rewards to come, are present to his mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I have heard the faith by Buddha taught<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lauded as pure and free from earthly taint;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then these carved and graven idols, fraught<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With gold and silver, gems, and jade, and paint?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heavens that roof this earth, mountain and dale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All that is great and grand, shall pass away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the art of gods may not prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall man’s poor handiwork escape decay?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fools that ye are! In this ignoble light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The true faith fades and passes out of sight.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As an official, Ch’ên Tzŭ-ang once gained great <i>kudos</i>
by a truly Solomonic decision. A man, having slain the
murderer of his father, was himself indicted for murder.
Ch’ên Tzŭ-ang caused him to be put to death, but at the
same time conferred an honorific distinction upon his
village for having produced so filial a son.</p>

<p>Not much is known of <span class="smcap">Sung Chih-wên</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 710),
at any rate to his good. On one occasion the Emperor
was so delighted with some of his verses that he took off
the Imperial robe and placed it on the poet’s shoulders.
This is one of his poems:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The dust of the morn<br /></span>
<span class="i10">had been laid by a shower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the trees by the bridge<br /></span>
<span class="i10">were all covered with flower,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When a white palfrey passed<br /></span>
<span class="i10">with a saddle of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a damsel as fair<br /></span>
<span class="i10">as the fairest of old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she veiled so discreetly<br /></span>
<span class="i10">her charms from my eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the boy who was with her<br /></span>
<span class="i10">quite felt for my sighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And although not a light-o’-love<br /></span>
<span class="i10">reckoned, I deem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was hard that this vision<br /></span>
<span class="i10">should pass like a dream.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">MÊNG HAO-JAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mêng Hao-jan</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 689-740) gave no sign in his youth
of the genius that was latent within him. He failed at
the public examinations, and retired to the mountains as
a recluse. He then became a poet of the first rank, and
his writings were eagerly sought after. At the age of forty
he went up to the capital, and was one day conversing
with his famous contemporary, Wang Wei, when suddenly
the Emperor was announced. He hid under a
couch, but Wang Wei betrayed him, the result being a
pleasant interview with his Majesty. The following is a
specimen of his verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The sun has set behind the western slope,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The eastern moon lies mirrored in the pool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With streaming hair my balcony I ope,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stretch my limbs out to enjoy the cool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loaded with lotus-scent the breeze sweeps by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clear dripping drops from tall bamboos I hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gaze upon my idle lute and sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas, no sympathetic soul is near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I doze, the while before mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear friends of other days in dream-clad forms arise.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Equally famous as poet and physician was <span class="smcap">Wang Wei</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 699-759). After a short spell of official life, he too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
retired into seclusion and occupied himself with poetry
and with the consolations of Buddhism, in which he was
a firm believer. His lines on bidding adieu to Mêng
Hao-jan, when the latter was seeking refuge on the
mountains, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dismounted, o’er wine<br /></span>
<span class="i14">we had said our last say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I whisper, ‘Dear friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">tell me, whither away?’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Alas!’ he replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">‘I am sick of life’s ills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I long for repose<br /></span>
<span class="i14">on the slumbering hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh seek not to pierce<br /></span>
<span class="i14">where my footsteps may stray:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white clouds will soothe me<br /></span>
<span class="i14">for ever and ay.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The accompanying “stop-short” by the same writer
is generally thought to contain an effective surprise in
the last line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Beneath the bamboo grove, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I seize my lute and sit and croon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No ear to hear me, save mine own:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No eye to see me&mdash;save the moon.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Wang Wei has been accused of loose writing and
incongruous pictures. A friendly critic defends him as
follows:&mdash;“For instance, there is Wang Wei, who introduces
bananas into a snow-storm. When, however,
we come to examine such points by the light of scholarship,
we see that his mind had merely passed into subjective
relationship with the things described. Fools say
he did not know heat from cold.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TS’UI HAO</div>

<p>A skilled poet, and a wine-bibber and gambler to
boot, was <span class="smcap">Ts’ui Hao</span>, who graduated about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 730.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He wrote a poem on the Yellow-Crane pagoda which
until quite recently stood on the bank of the Yang-tsze
near Hankow, and was put up to mark the spot where
Wang Tzŭ-ch’iao, who had attained immortality, went
up to heaven in broad daylight six centuries before the
Christian era. The great Li Po once thought of writing
on the theme, but he gave up the idea so soon as he had
read these lines by Ts’ui Hao:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Here a mortal once sailed<br /></span>

<span class="i14">its waves, and its foam.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">LI PO</div>

<p>By general consent <span class="smcap">Li Po</span> himself (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 705-762)
would probably be named as China’s greatest poet.
His wild Bohemian life, his gay and dissipated career at
Court, his exile, and his tragic end, all combine to form
a most effective setting for the splendid flow of verse
which he never ceased to pour forth. At the early age
of ten he wrote a “stop-short” to a firefly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Rain cannot quench thy lantern’s light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wind makes it shine more brightly bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh why not fly to heaven afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twinkle near the moon&mdash;a star?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>Li Po began by wandering about the country, until at
length, with five other tippling poets, he retired to the
mountains. For some time these Six Idlers of the
Bamboo Grove drank and wrote verses to their hearts’
content. By and by Li Po reached the capital, and
on the strength of his poetry was introduced to the
Emperor as a “banished angel.” He was received
with open arms, and soon became the spoilt child of
the palace. On one occasion, when the Emperor sent
for him, he was found lying drunk in the street; and it
was only after having his face well mopped with cold
water that he was fit for the Imperial presence. His
talents, however, did not fail him. With a lady of the
seraglio to hold his ink-slab, he dashed off some of
his most impassioned lines; at which the Emperor was
so overcome that he made the powerful eunuch Kao
Li-shih go down on his knees and pull off the poet’s
boots. On another occasion, the Emperor, who was
enjoying himself with his favourite lady in the palace
grounds, called for Li Po to commemorate the scene
in verse. After some delay the poet arrived, supported
between two eunuchs. “Please your Majesty,”
he said, “I have been drinking with the Prince and he
has made me drunk, but I will do my best.” Thereupon
two of the ladies of the harem held up in front
of him a pink silk screen, and in a very short time
he had thrown off no less than ten eight-line stanzas,
of which the following, describing the life of a palace
favourite, is one:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, the joy of youth spent<br /></span>
<span class="i16">in a gold-fretted hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Crape-flower Pavilion,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">the fairest of all,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My tresses for head-dress<br /></span>
<span class="i16">with gay garlands girt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carnations arranged<br /></span>
<span class="i16">o’er my jacket and skirt!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to wander away<br /></span>
<span class="i16">in the soft-scented air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And return by the side<br /></span>
<span class="i16">of his Majesty’s chair ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the dance and the song<br /></span>
<span class="i16">will be o’er by and by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall dislimn<br /></span>
<span class="i16">like the rack in the sky.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As time went on, Li Po fell a victim to intrigue, and
left the Court in disgrace. It was then that he wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My whitening hair would make a long, long rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet would not fathom all my depth of woe.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After more wanderings and much adventure, he was
drowned on a journey, from leaning one night too far
over the edge of a boat in a drunken effort to embrace
the reflection of the moon. Just previously he had
indited the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“An arbour of flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i10">and a kettle of wine:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the moon sheds her rays<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet their friendship I’ll borrow<br /></span>
<span class="i10">and gaily carouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laugh away sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i10">while spring-time allows.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

<span class="i0">“See the moon,&mdash;how she glances<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While sober I feel<br /></span>

<p>His control of the “stop-short” is considered to be
perfect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(1.) “The birds have all flown to their roost in the tree,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>One more extract may be given, chiefly to exhibit what
is held by the Chinese to be of the very essence of real
poetry,&mdash;suggestion. A poet should not dot his i’s.
The Chinese reader likes to do that for himself, each
according to his own fancy. Hence such a poem as the
following, often quoted as a model in its own particular
line:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A tortoise I see on a lotus-flower resting:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bird ’mid the reeds and the rushes is nesting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light skiff propelled by some boatman’s fair daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose song dies away o’er the fast-flowing water.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">TU FU</div>

<p>Another poet of the same epoch, of whom his countrymen
are also justly proud, is <span class="smcap">Tu Fu</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 712-770).
He failed to distinguish himself at the public examinations,
at which verse-making counts so much, but had
nevertheless such a high opinion of his own poetry
that he prescribed it as a cure for malarial fever. He
finally obtained a post at Court, which he was forced to
vacate in the rebellion of 755. As he himself wrote in
political allegory&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Full with the freshets of the spring the torrent rushes on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ferry-boat swings idly, for the ferry-man is gone.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After further vain attempts to make an official career,
he took to a wandering life, was nearly drowned by an
inundation, and was compelled to live for ten days on
roots. Being rescued, he succumbed next day to the effects
of eating roast-beef and drinking white wine to excess
after so long a fast. These are some of his poems:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of the poet <span class="smcap">Chang Ch’ien</span> not much is known. He
graduated in 727, and entered upon an official career,
but ultimately betook himself to the mountains and lived
as a hermit. He is said to have been a devotee of
Taoism. The following poem, however, which deals
with <i>dhyâna</i>, or the state of mental abstraction in which
all desire for existence is shaken off, would make it seem
as if his leanings had been Buddhistic. It gives a perfect
picture, so far as it goes, of the Buddhist retreat
often to be found among mountain peaks all over China,
visited by pilgrims who perform religious exercises or
fulfil vows at the feet of the World-Honoured, and by
contemplative students eager to shake off the “red dust”
of mundane affairs:&mdash;</p>

<p>There can be little doubt of the influence of Buddhism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
upon the poet <span class="smcap">Ts’ên Ts’an</span>, who graduated about 750,

<div class="sidenote">WANG CHIEN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wang Chien</span> took the highest degree in 775, and rose
to be Governor of a District. He managed, however, to
offend one of the Imperial clansmen, in consequence of
which his official career was abruptly cut short. He
wrote a good deal of verse, and was on terms of intimacy
with several of the great contemporary poets. In
the following lines, the metre of which is irregular, he
alludes to the extraordinary case of a soldier’s wife who
spent all her time on a hill-top looking down the Yang-tsze,
watching for her husband’s return from the wars.

<div class="sidenote">HAN YÜ</div>

<p>Passing over many poets equally well known with
some of those already cited, we reach a name undoubtedly
the most venerated of all those ever associated in
any way with the great mass of Chinese literature. <span class="smcap">Han Yü</span>
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 768-824), canonised and usually spoken of as
Han Wên-kung, was not merely a poet, but a statesman
of the first rank, and philosopher to boot. He rose from
among the humblest of the people to the highest offices
of State. In 803 he presented a memorial protesting
against certain extravagant honours with which the
Emperor Hsien Tsung proposed to receive a bone of
Buddha. The monarch was furious, and but for the
intercession of friends it would have fared badly with
the bold writer. As it was, he was banished to Ch’ao-chou
Fu in Kuangtung, where he set himself to civilise
the rude inhabitants of those wild parts. In a temple
at the summit of the neighbouring range there is to
be seen at this day a huge picture of the Prince of
Literature, as he has been called by foreigners from
his canonisation, with the following legend attached:&mdash;“Wherever
he passed, he purified.” He is even said to
have driven away a huge crocodile which was devastating
the watercourses in the neighbourhood; and the
denunciatory ultimatum which he addressed to the monster
and threw into the river, together with a pig and
a goat, is still regarded as a model of Chinese composition.
It was not very long ere he was recalled to
the capital and reinstated in office; but he had been
delicate all his life and had grown prematurely old,
and was thus unable to resist a severe illness which came
upon him. His friend and contemporary, Liu Tsung-yüan,
said that he never ventured to open the works of
Han Yü without first washing his hands in rose-water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
His writings, especially his essays, are often of the very
highest order, leaving nothing to be desired either in
originality or in style. But it is more than all for his
pure and noble character, his calm and dignified patriotism,
that the Chinese still keep his memory green. The
following lines were written by Su Tung-p’o, nearly 300
years after his death, for a shrine which had just been
put up in honour of the dead teacher by the people of
Ch’ao-chou Fu:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He rode on the dragon to the white cloud domain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grasped with his hand the glory of the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robed with the effulgence of the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind bore him delicately to the throne of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swept away the chaff and husks of his generation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roamed over the limits of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clothed all nature with his bright rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third in the triumvirate of genius.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rivals panted after him in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dazed by the brilliancy of the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cursed Buddha; he offended his prince;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He journeyed far away to the distant south;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed the grave of Shun, and wept over the daughters of Yao.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water-god went before him and stilled the waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drove out the fierce monster as it were a lamb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But above, in heaven, there was no music, and God was sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summoned him to his place beside the Throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, with these poor offerings, I salute him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With red lichees and yellow plantain fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that he did not linger awhile on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But passed so soon, with streaming hair, into the great unknown.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Han Yü wrote a large quantity of verse, frequently
playful, on an immense variety of subjects, and under
his touch the commonplace was often transmuted into
wit. Among other pieces there is one on his teeth,
which seemed to drop out at regular intervals, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
could calculate roughly what span of life remained to
him. Altogether, his poetry cannot be classed with that
of the highest order, unlike his prose writings, extracts
from which will be given in the next chapter. The
following poem is a specimen of his lighter vein:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Humane treatment of the lower animals is not generally
supposed to be a characteristic of the Chinese.
They have no Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which may perhaps account for some of their
shortcomings in this direction. Han Yü was above all
things of a kindly, humane nature, and although the
following piece cannot be taken seriously, it affords a
useful index to his general feelings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">PO CHÜ-I</div>

<p>Another famous poet, worthy to be mentioned even
after Han Yü, was <span class="smcap">Po Chü-I</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 772-846). As a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he was most precocious, knowing a considerable number
of the written characters at the early age of seven months,
after having had each one pointed out only once by his
nurse. He graduated at the age of seventeen, and rose
to high office in the State, though at one period of his
life he was banished to a petty post, which somewhat
disgusted him with officialdom. To console himself, he
built a retreat at Hsiang-shan, by which name he is
sometimes called; and there, together with eight congenial
companions, he gave himself up to poetry and
speculations upon a future life. To escape recognition
and annoyance, all names were dropped, and the party
was generally known as the Nine Old Gentlemen of
Hsiang-shan. This reaching the ears of the Emperor,
he was transferred to be Governor of Chung-chou; and
on the accession of Mu Tsung in 821 he was sent as
Governor to Hangchow. There he built one of the great
embankments of the beautiful Western Lake, still known
as Po’s Embankment. He was subsequently Governor
of Soochow, and finally rose in 841 to be President of
the Board of War. His poems were collected by
Imperial command and engraved upon tablets of stone,
which were set up in a garden he had made for himself
in imitation of his former beloved retreat at Hsiang-shan.
He disbelieved in the genuineness of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>,
and ridiculed its preposterous claims as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Who know, speak not; who speak, know naught,’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are words from Lao Tzŭ’s lore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then becomes of Lao Tzŭ’s own<br /></span>
<span class="i2">‘Five thousand words and more’?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is a charming poem from his pen, which tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the story of a poor lute-girl’s sorrows. This piece is
ranked very high by the commentator Lin Hsi-chung,
who points out how admirably the wording is adapted to
echo the sense, and declares that such workmanship
raises the reader to that state of mental ecstasy known
to the Buddhists as <i>samâdhi</i>, and can only be produced
once in a thousand autumns. The “guest” is the
poet himself, setting out a second time for his place
of banishment, as mentioned above, from a point
about half-way thither, where he had been struck
down by illness:&mdash;</p>

<p>“By night, at the riverside, adieus were spoken:
beneath the maple’s flower-like leaves, blooming amid
autumnal decay. Host had dismounted to speed the
parting guest, already on board his boat. Then a stirrup-cup
went round, but no flute, no guitar, was heard.
And so, ere the heart was warmed with wine, came
words of cold farewell beneath the bright moon, glittering
over the bosom of the broad stream ... when
suddenly across the water a lute broke forth into sound.
Host forgot to go, guest lingered on, wondering whence
the music, and asking who the performer might be. At
this, all was hushed, but no answer given. A boat
approached, and the musician was invited to join the
party. Cups were refilled, lamps trimmed again, and
preparations for festivity renewed. At length, after
much pressing, she came forth, hiding her face behind
her lute; and twice or thrice sweeping the strings,
betrayed emotion ere her song was sung. Then every
note she struck swelled with pathos deep and strong, as
though telling the tale of a wrecked and hopeless life,
while with bent head and rapid finger she poured forth
her soul in melody. Now softly, now slowly, her plec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>trum
sped to and fro; now this air, now that; loudly,
with the crash of falling rain; softly, as the murmur of
whispered words; now loud and soft together, like the
patter of pearls and pearlets dropping upon a marble
dish. Or liquid, like the warbling of the mango-bird in
the bush; trickling, like the streamlet on its downward
course. And then, like the torrent, stilled by the grip of
frost, so for a moment was the music lulled, in a passion
too deep for sound. Then, as bursts the water from the
broken vase, as clash the arms upon the mailed horseman,
so fell the plectrum once more upon the strings
with a slash like the rent of silk.</p>

<p>“Silence on all sides: not a sound stirred the air.
The autumn moon shone silver athwart the tide, as with
a sigh the musician thrust her plectrum beneath the
strings and quietly prepared to take leave. ‘My childhood,’
said she, ‘was spent at the capital, in my home
near the hills. At thirteen, I learnt the guitar, and my
name was enrolled among the <i>primas</i> of the day.
The <i>maëstro</i> himself acknowledged my skill: the most
beauteous of women envied my lovely face. The youths
of the neighbourhood vied with each other to do me
honour: a single song brought me I know not how
many costly bales. Golden ornaments and silver pins
were smashed, blood-red skirts of silk were stained with
wine, in oft-times echoing applause. And so I laughed
on from year to year, while the spring breeze and autumn
moon swept over my careless head.</p>

<p>“‘Then my brother went away to the wars: my mother
died. Nights passed and mornings came; and with
them my beauty began to fade. My doors were no
longer thronged; but few cavaliers remained. So I
took a husband and became a trader’s wife. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
all for gain, and little recked of separation from me.
Last month he went off to buy tea, and I remained
behind, to wander in my lonely boat on moon-lit
nights over the cold wave, thinking of the happy
days gone by, my reddened eyes telling of tearful
dreams.’</p>

<p>“The sweet melody of the lute had already moved my
soul to pity, and now these words pierced me to the
heart again. ‘O lady,’ I cried, ‘we are companions in
misfortune, and need no ceremony to be friends. Last
year I quitted the Imperial city, and fever-stricken
reached this spot, where in its desolation, from year’s
end to year’s end, no flute or guitar is heard. I live by
the marshy river-bank, surrounded by yellow reeds and
stunted bamboos. Day and night no sounds reach my
ears save the blood-stained note of the nightjar, the
gibbon’s mournful wail. Hill songs I have, and village
pipes with their harsh discordant twang. But now that I
listen to thy lute’s discourse, methinks ’tis the music of
the gods. Prithee sit down awhile and sing to us yet
again, while I commit thy story to writing.’</p>

<p>“Grateful to me (for she had been standing long), the
lute-girl sat down and quickly broke forth into another
song, sad and soft, unlike the song of just now. Then
all her hearers melted into tears unrestrained; and none
flowed more freely than mine, until my bosom was wet
with weeping.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the best known of all the works of Po Chü-i is
a narrative poem of some length entitled “The Everlasting
Wrong.” It refers to the ignominious downfall of the
Emperor known as Ming Huang (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 685-762), who himself
deserves a passing notice. At his accession to the
throne in 712, he was called upon to face an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on the part of his aunt, the T’ai-p’ing Princess, to displace
him; but this he succeeded in crushing, and entered
upon what promised to be a glorious reign. He began
with economy, closing the silk factories and forbidding
the palace ladies to wear jewels or embroideries, considerable
quantities of which were actually burnt. Until
740 the country was fairly prosperous. The administration
was improved, the empire was divided into fifteen
provinces, and schools were established in every village.
The Emperor was a patron of literature, and himself a
poet of no mean capacity. He published an edition of
the Classic of Filial Piety, and caused the text to be engraved
on four tablets of stone, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 745. His love of
war, however, and his growing extravagance, led to increased
taxation. Fond of music, he founded a college
for training youth of both sexes in this art. He surrounded
himself by a brilliant Court, welcoming such
men as the poet Li Po, at first for their talents alone,
but afterwards for their readiness to participate in scenes
of revelry and dissipation provided for the amusement
of the Imperial concubine, the ever-famous Yang Kuei-fei.
Eunuchs were appointed to official posts, and the
grossest forms of religious superstition were encouraged.
Women ceased to veil themselves as of old. Gradually
the Emperor left off concerning himself with affairs of
State; a serious rebellion broke out, and his Majesty
sought safety in flight to Ssŭch’uan, returning only after
having abdicated in favour of his son. The accompanying
poem describes the rise of Yang Kuei-fei, her tragic
fate at the hands of the soldiery, and her subsequent

<div class="sidenote">LI HO</div>

<p>A precocious and short-lived poet was <span class="smcap">Li Ho</span>, of the
ninth century. He began to write verses at the age
of seven. Twenty years later he met a strange man
riding on a hornless dragon, who said to him, “God
Almighty has finished his Jade Pavilion, and has sent
for you to be his secretary.” Shortly after this he died.
The following is a specimen of his poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With flowers on the ground like embroidery spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At twenty, the soft glow of wine in my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My white courser’s bit-tassels motionless gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the gold-threaded willow scent sweeps o’er the stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet until <em class="antiqua">she</em> has smiled, all these flowers yield no ray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her tresses fall down the whole landscape is gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hand on her sleeve as I gaze in her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kingfisher hairpin will soon be my prize.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang Chi</span>, who also flourished in the ninth century,
was eighty years old when he died. He was on terms
of close friendship with Han Yü, and like him, too, a
vigorous opponent of both Buddhism and Taoism. The
following is his most famous poem, the beauty of which,
says a commentator, lies beyond the words:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Knowing, fair sir, my matrimonial thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two pearls thou sentest me, costly withal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, seeing that Love thy heart possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrapped them coldly in my silken vest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For mine is a household of high degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My husband captain in the King’s army;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one with wit like thine should say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘The troth of wives is for ever and ay.’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“With thy two pearls I send thee back two tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears&mdash;that we did not meet in earlier years.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many more poets of varying shades of excellence
must here be set aside, their efforts often brightened by
those quaint conceits which are so dear to the Chinese
reader, but which approach so perilously near to bathos
when they appear in foreign garb. A few specimens,
torn from their setting, may perhaps have an interest of
their own. Here is a lady complaining of the leaden-footed
flight of time as marked by the water-clock:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It seems that the clepsydra<br /></span>
<span class="i8">has been filled up with the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the long, long night appear<br /></span>
<span class="i8">an endless night to me!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second line in the next example is peculiarly
characteristic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dusk comes, the east wind blows, and birds<br /></span>
<span class="i4">pipe forth a mournful sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Petals, like nymphs from balconies,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">come tumbling to the ground.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next refers to candles burning in a room where
two friends are having a last talk on the night before
parting for a long period:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The very wax sheds sympathetic tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gutters sadly down till dawn appears.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>This last is from a friend to a friend at a distance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Ah, when shall we ever snuff candles again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And recall the glad hours of that evening of rain?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">LI SHÊ</div>

<p>A popular poet of the ninth century was <span class="smcap">Li Shê</span>,
especially well known for the story of his capture by
highwaymen. The chief knew him by name and called
for a sample of his art, eliciting the following lines, which
immediately secured his release:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The rainy mist sweeps gently o’er the village by the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the leafy forest glades the brigand daggers gleam....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet there is no need to fear, nor step from out their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For more than half the world consists of bigger rogues than they!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A popular physician in great request, as well as a poet,
was <span class="smcap">Ma Tzŭ-Jan</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 880). He studied Taoism in
a hostile sense, as would appear from the following poem
by him; nevertheless, according to tradition, he was
ultimately taken up to heaven alive:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In youth I went to study <span class="antiqua"><span class="smcap">Tao</span></span> at its living fountain-head,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">‘What oaf is this,’ the Master cried, ‘content with human lot?’<br /></span>

<p>It is time perhaps to bring to a close the long list,
which might be almost indefinitely lengthened. <span class="smcap">Ssŭ-k’ung
T’u</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 834-908) was a secretary in the Board of
Rites, but he threw up his post and became a hermit. Returning
to Court in 905, he accidentally dropped part
of his official insignia at an audience,&mdash;an unpardonable
breach of Court etiquette,&mdash;and was allowed to retire
once more to the hills, where he ultimately starved himself
to death through grief at the murder of the youthful
Emperor. He is commonly known as the Last of the
T’angs; his poetry, which is excessively difficult to understand,
ranking correspondingly high in the estimation of
Chinese critics. The following philosophical poem, consisting
of twenty-four apparently unconnected stanzas,
is admirably adapted to exhibit the form under which
pure Taoism commends itself to the mind of a cultivated
scholar:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<i>CLASSICAL AND GENERAL LITERATURE</i></h3>


<p>The classical scholarship of the Tang dynasty was
neither very original nor very profound. It is true that the
second Emperor founded a College of Learning, but its
members were content to continue the traditions of the
Hans, and comparatively little was achieved in the line
of independent research. Foremost among the names
in the above College stands that of <span class="smcap">Lu Yüan-lang</span>
(550-625). He had been Imperial Librarian under the
preceding dynasty, and later on distinguished himself
by his defence of Confucianism against both Buddhist
and Taoist attacks. He published a valuable work on
the explanations of terms and phrases in the Classics and
in Taoist writers.</p>

<p>Scarcely less eminent as a scholar was <span class="smcap">Wei Chêng</span>
(581-643), who also gained great reputation as a
military commander. He was appointed President of
the Commission for drawing up the history of the
previous dynasty, and he was, in addition, a poet of no
mean order. At his death the Emperor said, “You may
use copper as a mirror for the person; you may use the
past as a mirror for politics; and you may use man as
a mirror to guide one’s judgment in ordinary affairs.
These three mirrors I have always carefully cherished;
but now that Wei Chêng is gone, I have lost one of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Another well-known scholar is <span class="smcap">Yen Shih-ku</span> (579-645).
He was employed upon a recension of the
Classics, and also upon a new and annotated edition of
the history of the Han dynasty; but his exegesis in the
former case caused dissatisfaction, and he was ordered to
a provincial post. Although nominally reinstated before
this degradation took effect, his ambition was so far
wounded that he ceased to be the same man. He lived
henceforth a retired and simple life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Li Po-yao</span> (565-648) was so sickly a child, and
swallowed so much medicine, that his grandmother
insisted on naming him Po-yao = Pharmacopœia, while
his precocious cleverness earned for him the sobriquet
of the Prodigy. Entering upon a public career, he
neglected his work for gaming and drink, and after a
short spell of office he retired. Later on he rose
once more, and completed the History of the Northern
Ch’i Dynasty.</p>

<p>A descendant of Confucius in the thirty-second
degree, and a distinguished scholar and public functionary,
was <span class="smcap">K’ung Ying-ta</span> (574-648). He wrote a commentary
on the Book of Odes, and is credited with
certain portions of the History of the Sui Dynasty.
Besides this, he is responsible for comments and glosses
on the Great Learning and on the Doctrine of the Mean.</p>

<p>Lexicography was perhaps the department of pure
scholarship in which the greatest advances were made.
Dictionaries on the phonetic system, based upon the
work of Lu Fa-yen of the sixth century, came very
much into vogue, as opposed to those on the radical
system initiated by Hsü Shên. Not that the splendid
work of the latter was allowed to suffer from neglect.
<span class="smcap">Li Yang-ping</span>, of the eighth century, devoted much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
time and labour to improving and adding to its pages.
The latter was a Government official, and when filling a
post as magistrate in 763, he is said to have obtained
rain during a drought by threatening the City God with
the destruction of his temple unless his prayers were
answered within three days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANG CHIH-HO</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chang Chih-ho</span> (eighth century), author of a work
on the conservation of vitality, was of a romantic turn of
mind and especially fond of Taoist speculations. He
took office under the Emperor Su Tsung of the T’ang
dynasty, but got into some trouble and was banished.
Soon after this he shared in a general pardon; whereupon
he fled to the woods and mountains and became a
wandering recluse, calling himself the Old Fisherman of
the Mists and Waters. He spent his time in angling, but
used no bait, his object not being to catch fish. When
asked why he roamed about, Chang answered and said,
“With the empyrean as my home, the bright moon my
constant companion, and the four seas my inseparable
friends,&mdash;what mean you by <i>roaming</i>?” And when a
friend offered him a comfortable home instead of his
poor boat, he replied, “I prefer to follow the gulls into
cloudland, rather than to bury my eternal self beneath
the dust of the world.”</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>T’ung Tien</cite>, an elaborate treatise on
the constitution, still extant, was <span class="smcap">Tu Yu</span> (<i>d.</i> 812). It
is divided into eight sections under Political Economy,
Examinations and Degrees, Government Offices, Rites,
Music, Military Discipline, Geography, and National
Defences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIU TSUNG-YÜAN</div>

<p>Among writers of general prose literature, <span class="smcap">Liu Tsung-yüan</span>
(773-819) has left behind him much that for purity
of style and felicity of expression has rarely been sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>passed.
Besides being poet, essayist, and calligraphist,
he was a Secretary in the Board of Rites. There he
became involved in a conspiracy, and was banished to a
distant spot, where he died. His views were deeply
tinged with Buddhist thought, for which he was often
severely censured, once in a letter by his friend and
master, Han Yü. These few lines are part of his reply
on the latter occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The features I admire in Buddhism are those which
are coincident with the principles enunciated in our own
sacred books. And I do not think that, even were the
holy sages of old to revisit the earth, they would fairly be
able to denounce these. Now, Han Yü objects to the
Buddhist commandments. He objects to the bald pates
of the priests, their dark robes, their renunciation of
domestic ties, their idleness, and life generally at the
expense of others. So do I. But Han Yü misses the
kernel while railing at the husk. He sees the lode, but
not the ore. I see both; hence my partiality for this
faith.</p>

<p>“Again, intercourse with men of this religion does not
necessarily imply conversion. Even if it did, Buddhism
admits no envious rivalry for place or power. The
majority of its adherents love only to lead a simple life of
contemplation amid the charms of hill and stream. And
when I turn my gaze towards the hurry-scurry of the
age, in its daily race for the seals and tassels of office, I
ask myself if I am to reject those in order to take my
place among the ranks of these.</p>

<p>“The Buddhist priest, Hao-ch’u, is a man of placid
temperament and of passions subdued. He is a fine
scholar. His only joy is to muse o’er flood and fell,
with occasional indulgence in the delights of composi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>tion.
His family follow in the same path. He is
independent of all men, and no more to be compared
with those heterodox sages of whom we make so much
than with the vulgar herd of the greedy, grasping world
around us.”</p>

<p>On this the commentator remarks, that one must have
the genius of Han Yü to condemn Buddhism, the genius
of Liu Tsung-yüan to indulge in it.</p>

<p>Here is a short study on a great question:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Over the western hills the road trends away towards
the north, and on the farther side of the pass separates
into two. The westerly branch leads to nowhere in
particular; but if you follow the other, which takes a
north-easterly turn, for about a quarter of a mile, you
will find that the path ends abruptly, while the stream
forks to enclose a steep pile of boulders. On the
summit of this pile there is what appears to be an
elegantly built look-out tower; below, as it were a
battlemented wall, pierced by a city gate, through which
one gazes into darkness. A stone thrown in here falls
with a splash suggestive of water, and the reverberations
of this sound are audible for some time. There is a way
round from behind up to the top, whence nothing is
seen far and wide except groves of fine straight trees,
which, strange to say, are grouped symmetrically, as if
by an artist’s hand.</p>

<p>“Now, I have always had my doubts about the
existence of a God, but this scene made me think He
really must exist. At the same time, however, I began
to wonder why He did not place it in some worthy
centre of civilisation, rather than in this out-of-the-way
barbarous region, where for centuries there has been no
one to enjoy its beauty. And so, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
such waste of labour and incongruity of position disposed
me to think that there cannot be a God after all.”</p>

<p>One favourite piece is a letter which Liu Tsung-yüan
writes in a bantering style to congratulate a well-to-do
literary man on having lost everything in a fire,
especially, as he explains, if the victim has been “utterly
and irretrievably beggared.” It will give such a rare
opportunity, he points out, to show the world that there
was no connection whatever between worldly means
and literary reputation.</p>

<p>A well-known satirical piece by Liu Tsung-yüan is
entitled “Catching Snakes,” and is directed against
the hardships of over-taxation:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the wilds of Hu-kuang there is an extraordinary
kind of snake, having a black body with white rings.
Deadly fatal, even to the grass and trees it may chance
to touch; in man, its bite is absolutely incurable. Yet,
if caught and prepared, when dry, in the form of cakes,
the flesh of this snake will soothe excitement, heal
leprous sores, remove sloughing flesh, and expel evil
spirits. And so it came about that the Court physician,
acting under Imperial orders, exacted from each family
a return of two of these snakes every year; but as few
persons were able to comply with the demand, it was
subsequently made known that the return of snakes was
to be considered in lieu of the usual taxes. Thereupon
there ensued a general stampede among the people of
those parts.”</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that snake-catching was
actually less deadly than paying such taxes as were
exacted from those who dared not face its risks and
elected to contribute in the ordinary way. One man,
whose father and grandfather had both perished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
snake-bites, declared that after all he was better off than
his neighbours, who were ground down and beggared by
the iniquities of the tax-gatherer. “Harsh tyrants,” he
explained, “sweep down upon us, and throw everybody
and everything, even to the brute beasts, into paroxysms
of terror and disorder. But I,&mdash;I get up in the morning
and look into the jar where my snakes are kept; and
if they are still there, I lie down at night in peace. At
the appointed time, I take care that they are fit to be
handed in; and when that is done, I retire to enjoy the
produce of my farm and complete the allotted span of
my existence. Only twice a year have I to risk my life:
the rest is peaceful enough and not to be compared with
the daily round of annoyance which falls to the share of
my fellow-villagers.”</p>

<p>A similar satire on over-government introduces a
deformed gardener called Camel-back. This man was
extraordinarily successful as a nurseryman:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One day a customer asked him how this was so; to
which he replied, ‘Old Camel-back cannot make trees
live or thrive. He can only let them follow their
natural tendencies. Now in planting trees, be careful
to set the root straight, to smooth the earth around
them, to use good mould, and to ram it down well.
Then, don’t touch them; don’t think about them; don’t
go and look at them; but leave them alone to take care
of themselves, and nature will do the rest. I only avoid
trying to make my trees grow. I have no special
method of cultivation, no special means for securing
luxuriance of growth. I only don’t spoil the fruit. I
have no way of getting it either early or in abundance.
Other gardeners set with bent root and neglect the
mould. They heap up either too much earth or too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
little. Or if not this, then they become too fond of and
too anxious about their trees, and are for ever running
backwards and forwards to see how they are growing;
sometimes scratching them to make sure they are still
alive, or shaking them about to see if they are sufficiently
firm in the ground; thus constantly interfering with the
natural bias of the tree, and turning their affection and
care into an absolute bane and a curse. I only don’t do
these things. That’s all.’</p>

<p>“‘Can these principles you have just now set forth
be applied to government?’ asked his listener. ‘Ah!’
replied Camel-back, ‘I only understand nursery-gardening:
government is not my trade. Still, in the village
where I live, the officials are for ever issuing all kinds of
orders, as if greatly compassionating the people, though
really to their utter injury. Morning and night the
underlings come round and say, ‘His Honour bids us
urge on your ploughing, hasten your planting, and
superintend your harvest. Do not delay with your
spinning and weaving. Take care of your children.
Rear poultry and pigs. Come together when the drum
beats. Be ready at the sound of the rattle.’ Thus are
we poor people badgered from morn till eve. We have
not a moment to ourselves. How could any one flourish
and develop naturally under such conditions?’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HAN YÜ</div>

<p>In his prose writings Han Yü showed even more
variety of subject than in his verse. His farewell words
to his dead friend Liu Tsung-yüan, read, according to
Chinese custom, by the side of the bier or at the grave,
and then burnt as a means of communicating them to
the deceased, are widely known to his countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Alas! Tzŭ-hou, and hast thou come to this pass?&mdash;Fool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
that I am! is it not the pass to which mortals have
ever come? Man is born into the world like a dream:
what need has he to take note of gain or loss? While
the dream lasts, he may sorrow or may joy; but when
the awakening is at hand, why cling regretfully to the
past?</p>

<p>“’Twere well for all things an they had no worth.
The excellence of its wood is the bane of the tree. And
thou, whose early genius knew no curb, weaver of the
jewelled words, thou wilt be remembered when the imbeciles
of fortune and place are forgot.</p>

<p>“The unskilful bungler hacks his hands and streams
with sweat, while the expert craftsman looks on with
folded arms. O my friend, thy work was not for this
age; though I, a bungler, have found employment in the
service of the State. Thou didst know thyself above the
common herd; but when in shame thou didst depart
never to return, the Philistines usurped thy place.</p>

<p>“Alas! Tzŭ-hou, now thou art no more. But thy last
wish, that I should care for thy little son, is still ringing
sadly in my ears. The friendships of the day are those
of self-interest alone. How can I feel sure that I shall
live to carry out thy behest? I did not arrogate to myself
this duty. Thou thyself hast bidden me to the task; and,
by the Gods above, I will not betray thy trust.</p>

<p>“Thou hast gone to thy eternal home, and wilt not
return. With these sacrifices by thy coffin’s side, I utter
an affectionate farewell.”</p>

<p>The following passages are taken from his essay on the
Way or Method of Confucianism:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Had there been no sages of old, the race of man
would have long since become extinct. Men have not
fur and feathers and scales to adjust the temperature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
their bodies; neither have they claws and fangs to aid
them in the struggle for food. Hence their organisation,
as follows:&mdash;The sovereign issues commands. The
minister carries out these commands, and makes them
known to the people. The people produce grain and
flax and silk, fashion articles of everyday use, and interchange
commodities, in order to fulfil their obligations to
their rulers. The sovereign who fails to issue his commands
loses his <i>raison d’être</i>; the minister who fails to
carry out his sovereign’s commands, and to make them
known to the people, loses his <i>raison d’être</i>; the people
who fail to produce grain and flax and silk, fashion
articles of everyday use, and interchange commodities,
in order to fulfil their obligations to their rulers, should
lose their heads.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And if I am asked what Method is this, I reply that
it is what I call <em>the</em> Method, and not merely a method
like those of Lao Tzŭ and Buddha. The Emperor Yao
handed it down to the Emperor Shun; the Emperor
Shun handed it down to the Great Yü; and so on until
it reached Confucius, and lastly Mencius, who died without
transmitting it to any one else. Then followed the
heterodox schools of Hsün and Yang, wherein much
that was essential was passed over, while the criterion
was vaguely formulated. In the days before Chou Kung,
the Sages were themselves rulers; hence they were able
to secure the reception of their Method. In the days
after Chou Kung, the Sages were all high officers of
State; hence its duration through a long period of time.</p>

<p>“And now, it will be asked, what is the remedy? I
answer that unless these false doctrines are rooted out,
the true faith will not prevail. Let us insist that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
followers of Lao Tzŭ and Buddha behave themselves
like ordinary mortals. Let us burn their books. Let us
turn their temples into dwelling-houses. Let us make
manifest the Method of our ancient kings, in order that
men may be led to embrace its teachings.”</p>

<p>Of the character of Han Yü’s famous ultimatum to the
crocodile, which all Chinese writers have regarded as
a real creature, though probably the name is but an
allegorical veil, the following extract may suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O Crocodile! thou and I cannot rest together here.
The Son of Heaven has confided this district and this
people to my charge; and thou, O goggle-eyed, by
disturbing the peace of this river and devouring the
people and their domestic animals, the bears, the boars,
and deer of the neighbourhood, in order to batten thyself
and reproduce thy kind,&mdash;thou art challenging me to a
struggle of life and death. And I, though of weakly
frame, am I to bow the knee and yield before a crocodile?
No! I am the lawful guardian of this place, and
I would scorn to decline thy challenge, even were it to
cost me my life.</p>

<p>“Still, in virtue of my commission from the Son of
Heaven, I am bound to give fair warning; and thou, O
crocodile, if thou art wise, will pay due heed to my
words. There before thee lies the broad ocean, the
domain alike of the whale and the shrimp. Go thither
and live in peace. It is but the journey of a day.”</p>

<p>The death of a dearly loved nephew, comparatively
near to him in age, drew from Han Yü a long and pathetic
“In Memoriam,” conveyed, as mentioned above, to the
ears of the departed through the medium of fire and
smoke. These are two short extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The line of my noble-hearted brother has indeed been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
prematurely cut off. Thy pure intelligence, hope of the
family, survives not to continue the traditions of his
house. Unfathomable are the appointments of what
men call Heaven: inscrutable are the workings of the
unseen: unknowable are the mysteries of eternal truth:
unrecognisable those who are destined to attain to old age!</p>

<p>“Henceforth my grey hairs will grow white, my strength
fail. Physically and mentally hurrying on to decay, how
long before I shall follow thee? If there is knowledge
after death, this separation will be but for a little while.
If there is not knowledge after death, so will this sorrow
be but for a little while, and then no more sorrow for ever.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“O ye blue heavens, when shall my sorrow have
end? Henceforth the world has no charms. I will
get me a few acres on the banks of the Ying, and there
await the end, teaching my son and thy son, if haply
they may grow up,&mdash;my daughter and thy daughter, until
their day of marriage comes. Alas! though words fail,
love endureth. Dost thou hear, or dost thou not hear?
Woe is me: Heaven bless thee!”</p>

<p>Of all Han Yü’s writings in prose or in verse, there
was not one which caused anything like the sensation
produced by his memorial to the Emperor on the subject
of Buddha’s bone. The fact was, Buddhism was
making vast strides in popular esteem, and but for
some such bold stand as was made on this occasion by
a leading man, the prestige of Confucianism would have
received a staggering blow. Here is an extract from
this fiery document, which sent its author into exile and
nearly cost him his life:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your servant has now heard that instructions have
been issued to the priestly community to proceed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Fêng-hsiang and receive a bone of Buddha, and that
from a high tower your Majesty will view its introduction
into the Imperial Palace; also that orders have
been sent to the various temples, commanding that
the relic be received with the proper ceremonies. Now,
foolish though your servant may be, he is well aware
that your Majesty does not do this in the vain hope
of deriving advantages therefrom; but that in the fulness
of our present plenty, and in the joy which reigns
in the heart of all, there is a desire to fall in with the
wishes of the people in the celebration at the capital
of this delusive mummery. For how could the wisdom
of your Majesty stoop to participate in such ridiculous
beliefs? Still the people are slow of perception and
easily beguiled; and should they behold your Majesty
thus earnestly worshipping at the feet of Buddha, they
would cry out, ‘See! the Son of Heaven, the All-Wise,
is a fervent believer; who are we, his people, that we
should spare our bodies?’ Then would ensue a
scorching of heads and burning of fingers; crowds
would collect together, and, tearing off their clothes and
scattering their money, would spend their time from
morn to eve in imitation of your Majesty’s example.
The result would be that by and by young and old,
seized with the same enthusiasm, would totally neglect
the business of their lives; and should your Majesty not
prohibit it, they would be found flocking to the temples,
ready to cut off an arm or slice their bodies as an offering
to the god. Thus would our traditions and customs
be seriously injured, and ourselves become a laughing-stock
on the face of the earth;&mdash;truly, no small matter!</p>

<p>“For Buddha was a barbarian. His language was
not the language of China. His clothes were of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
alien cut. He did not utter the maxims of our ancient
rulers, nor conform to the customs which they have
handed down. He did not appreciate the bond between
prince and minister, the tie between father and son.
Supposing, indeed, this Buddha had come to our capital
in the flesh, under an appointment from his own State,
then your Majesty might have received him with a few
words of admonition, bestowing on him a banquet and
a suit of clothes, previous to sending him out of the
country with an escort of soldiers, and thereby have
avoided any dangerous influence on the minds of the
people. But what are the facts? The bone of a man
long since dead and decomposed is to be admitted,
forsooth, within the precincts of the Imperial Palace!
Confucius said, ‘Pay all respect to spiritual beings, but
keep them at a distance.’ And so, when the princes of
old paid visits of condolence to one another, it was
customary for them to send on a magician in advance,
with a peach-wand in his hand, whereby to expel all
noxious influences previous to the arrival of his master.
Yet now your Majesty is about to causelessly introduce
a disgusting object, personally taking part in the proceedings,
without the intervention either of the magician
or of his peach-wand. Of the officials, not one has
raised his voice against it; of the censors, not one has
pointed out the enormity of such an act. Therefore
your servant, overwhelmed with shame for the censors,
implores your Majesty that these bones be handed
over for destruction by fire or water, whereby the root
of this great evil may be exterminated for all time,

of such a deed will be beyond all praise. And should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the Lord Buddha have power to avenge this insult by

<div class="sidenote">LI HUA</div>

<p>A writer named <span class="smcap">Li Hua</span>, of whom little is known
except that he flourished in the ninth century, has left
behind him one very much admired piece entitled “On
an Old Battlefield”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Vast, vast,&mdash;a limitless extent of flat sand, without a
human being in sight, girdled by a stream and dotted
with hills, where in the dismal twilight the wind moans
at the setting sun. Shrubs gone: grass withered: all
chill as the hoar-frost of early morn. The birds of the
air fly past: the beasts of the field shun the spot; for it
is, as I was informed by the keeper, the site of an old
battlefield. ‘Many a time and oft,’ said he, ‘has an
army been overthrown on this spot; and the voices of
the dead may frequently be heard weeping and wailing
in the darkness of the night.’”</p>

<p>This is how the writer calls up in imagination the
ghastly scene of long ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>“And now the cruel spear does its work, the startled
sand blinds the combatants locked fast in the death-struggle;
while hill and vale and stream groan beneath
the flash and crash of arms. By and by, the chill
cold shades of night fall upon them, knee-deep in snow,
beards stiff with ice. The hardy vulture seeks its nest:
the strength of the war-horse is broken. Clothes are of
no avail; hands frost-bitten, flesh cracked. Even nature
lends her aid to the Tartars, contributing a deadly blast,
the better to complete the work of slaughter begun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Ambulance waggons block the way: our men succumb
to flank attacks. Their officers have surrendered: their
general is dead. The river is choked with corpses to
its topmost banks: the fosses of the Great Wall are
swimming over with blood. All distinctions are obliterated
in that heap of rotting bones....</p>

<p>“Faintly and more faintly beats the drum. Strength
exhausted, arrows spent, bow-strings snapped, swords
shattered, the two armies fall upon one another in the
supreme struggle for life or death. To yield is to
become the barbarian’s slave: to fight is to mingle our
bones with the desert sand....</p>

<p>“No sound of bird now breaks from the hushed hillside.
All is still save the wind whistling through the
long night. Ghosts of the dead wander hither and
thither in the gloom: spirits from the nether world
collect under the dark clouds. The sun rises and shines
coldly over the trampled grass, while the fading moon
still twinkles upon the frost flakes scattered around.
What sight more horrible than this!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MEN OF T’ANG</div>

<p>The havoc wrought by the dreaded Tartars is indeed
the theme of many a poem in prose as well as in verse.
The following lines by <span class="smcap">Ch’ên T’ao</span>, of about this date,
record a patriotic oath of indignant volunteers and the
mournful issue of fruitless valour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They swore the Huns should perish: they would die if needs they must....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now five thousand, sable-clad, have bit the Tartar dust.<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>Among their other glories, the T’angs may be said
to have witnessed the birth of popular literature, soon
to receive, in common with classical scholarship, an
impetus the like of which had never yet been felt.</p>

<p>But we must now take leave of this dynasty, the
name of which has survived in common parlance to this
day. For just as the northerners are proud to call themselves
“sons of Han,” so do the Chinese of the more
southern provinces still delight to be known as the “men
of T’ang.”</p>

<h2>BOOK THE FIFTH<br />

<span class="smaller"><i>THE SUNG DYNASTY</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 900-1200)</span></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

THE INVENTION OF BLOCK-PRINTING</h3>


<p>The T’ang dynasty was brought to an end in 907, and
during the succeeding fifty years the empire experienced
no fewer than five separate dynastic changes. It was
not a time favourable to literary effort; still production
was not absolutely at a standstill, and some minor names
have come down to us.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Chang Pi</span>, for instance, of the later Chou dynasty,
little is known, except that he once presented a voluminous
memorial to his sovereign in the hope of staving
off political collapse. The memorial, we are told, was
much admired, but the advice contained in it was not
acted upon. These few lines of his occur in many a
poetical garland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“After parting, dreams possessed me, and I wandered you know where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we sat in the verandah, and you sang the sweet old air.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then I woke, with no one near me save the moon, still shining on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighting up dead petals which like you have passed and gone.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is, however, at least one name of absorbing
interest to the foreign student. <span class="smcap">Fêng Tao</span> (881-954)
is best known to the Chinese as a versatile politician
who served first and last under no less than ten Emperors
of four different Houses, and gave himself a
sobriquet which finds its best English equivalent in
“The Vicar of Bray.” He presented himself at the
Court of the second Emperor of the Liao dynasty and
positively asked for a post. He said he had no home,
no money, and very little brains; a statement which
appears to have appealed forcibly to the Tartar monarch,
who at once appointed him grand tutor to the heir-apparent.
By foreigners, on the other hand, he will be
chiefly remembered as the inventor of the art of block-printing.
It seems probable, indeed, that some crude
form of this invention had been already known early
in the T’ang dynasty, but until the date of Fêng Tao
it was certainly not applied to the production of books.
Six years after his death the “fire-led” House of Sung
was finally established upon the throne, and thenceforward
the printing of books from blocks became a
familiar handicraft with the Chinese people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOLDEN TARTARS</div>

<p>With the advent of this new line, we pass, as the
Chinese fairy-stories say, to “another heaven and earth.”
The various departments of history, classical scholarship,
general literature, lexicography, and poetry were again
filled with enthusiastic workers, eagerly encouraged by
a succession of enlightened rulers. And although there
was a falling-off consequent upon the irruption of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Golden Tartars in 1125-1127, when the ex-Emperor and
his newly appointed successor were carried captive to
the north, nevertheless the Sungs managed to create a
great epoch, and are justly placed in the very first rank
among the builders of Chinese literature.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

HISTORY&mdash;CLASSICAL AND GENERAL
LITERATURE</h3>


<div class="sidenote">OU-YANG HSIU</div>

<p>The first move made in the department of history was
nothing less than to re-write the whole of the chronicles
of the T’ang dynasty. The usual scheme had
already been carried out by Liu Hsü (897-946), a learned
scholar of the later Chin dynasty, but on many grounds
the result was pronounced unsatisfactory, and steps
were taken to supersede it. The execution of this project
was entrusted to Ou-yang Hsiu and Sung Ch’i, both
of whom were leading men in the world of letters.
<span class="smcap">Ou-yang Hsiu</span> (1007-1072) had been brought up in
poverty, his mother teaching him to write with a reed.
By the time he was fifteen his great abilities began to
attract attention, and later on he came out first on the
list of candidates for the third or highest degree. His
public life was a chequered one, owing to the bold
positions he took up in defence of what he believed to
be right, regardless of personal interest. Besides the
dynastic history, he wrote on all kinds of subjects, grave
and gay, including an exposition of the Book of Poetry,
a work on ancient inscriptions, anecdotes of the men of
his day, an elaborate treatise on the peony, poetry and
essays without end. The following is a specimen of his
lighter work, greatly admired for the beauty of its style,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and diligently read by all students of composition. The
theme, as the reader will perceive, is the historian himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The district of Ch’u is entirely surrounded by hills,
and the peaks to the south-west are clothed with a
dense and beautiful growth of trees, over which the eye
wanders in rapture away to the confines of Shantung.
A walk of two or three miles on those hills brings one
within earshot of the sound of falling water, which
gushes forth from a ravine known as the Wine-Fountain;
while hard by in a nook at a bend of the road stands
a kiosque, commonly spoken of as the Old Drunkard’s
Arbour. It was built by a Buddhist priest, called
Deathless Wisdom, who lived among these hills, and
who received the above name from the Governor.
The latter used to bring his friends hither to take wine;
and as he personally was incapacitated by a very few
cups, and was, moreover, well stricken in years, he gave
himself the sobriquet of the Old Drunkard. But it was
not wine that attracted him to this spot. It was the
charming scenery, which wine enabled him to enjoy.</p>

<p>“The sun’s rays peeping at dawn through the trees,
by and by to be obscured behind gathering clouds,
leaving naught but gloom around, give to this spot the
alternations of morning and night. The wild-flowers
exhaling their perfume from the darkness of some shady
dell, the luxuriant foliage of the dense forest of beautiful
trees, the clear frosty wind, and the naked boulders
of the lessening torrent,&mdash;these are the indications of
spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Morning is the
time to go thither, returning with the shades of night,
and although the place presents a different aspect with
the changes of the seasons, its charms are subject to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
interruption, but continue alway. Burden-carriers sing
their way along the road, travellers rest awhile under
the trees, shouts from one, responses from another,
old people hobbling along, children in arms, children
dragged along by hand, backwards and forwards all
day long without a break,&mdash;these are the people of Ch’u.
A cast in the stream and a fine fish taken from some spot
where the eddying pools begin to deepen; a draught of
cool wine from the fountain, and a few such dishes of
meats and fruits as the hills are able to provide,&mdash;these,
nicely spread out beforehand, constitute the Governor’s
feast. And in the revelry of the banquet-hour there is
no thought of toil or trouble. Every archer hits his
mark, and every player wins his <i>partie</i>; goblets flash
from hand to hand, and a buzz of conversation is heard
as the guests move unconstrainedly about. Among them
is an old man with white hair, bald at the top of his head.
This is the drunken Governor, who, when the evening
sun kisses the tips of the hills and the falling shadows
are drawn out and blurred, bends his steps homewards
in company with his friends. Then in the growing
darkness are heard sounds above and sounds below; the
beasts of the field and the birds of the air are rejoicing
at the departure of man. They, too, can rejoice in hills
and in trees, but they cannot rejoice as man rejoices.
So also the Governor’s friends. They rejoice with him,
though they know not at what it is that he rejoices.
Drunk, he can rejoice with them, sober, he can discourse
with them,&mdash;such is the Governor. And should you ask
who is the Governor, I reply, ‘Ou-yang Hsiu of Lu-ling.’”</p>

<p>Besides dwelling upon the beauty of this piece as
vividly portraying the spirit of the age in which it was
written, the commentator proudly points out that in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the particle <i>yeh</i>, with influences as subtle as those of
the Greek γε, occurs no fewer than twenty times.</p>

<p>The next piece is entitled “An Autumn Dirge,” and
refers to the sudden collapse of summer, so common a
phenomenon in the East:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One night I had just sat down to my books, when
suddenly I heard a sound far away towards the south-west.
Listening intently, I wondered what it could be.
On it came, at first like the sighing of a gentle zephyr
... gradually deepening into the plash of waves upon a
surf-beat shore ... the roaring of huge breakers in the
startled night, amid howling storm-gusts of wind and
rain. It burst upon the hanging bell, and set every one
of its pendants tinkling into tune. It seemed like the
muffled march of soldiers, hurriedly advancing, bit in
mouth, to the attack, when no shouted orders rend the
air, but only the tramp of men and horses meet the ear.</p>

<p>“‘Boy,’ said I, ‘what noise is that? Go forth and see.’
‘Sir,’ replied the boy on his return, ‘the moon and stars
are brightly shining: the Silver River spans the sky.
No sound of man is heard without: ’tis but the whispering
of the trees.’</p>

<p>“‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘autumn is upon us. And is it thus,
O boy, that autumn comes?&mdash;autumn, the cruel and the
cold; autumn, the season of rack and mist; autumn, the
season of cloudless skies; autumn, the season of piercing
blasts; autumn, the season of desolation and blight!
Chill is the sound that heralds its approach, and then it
leaps upon us with a shout. All the rich luxuriance of
green is changed, all the proud foliage of the forest
swept down to earth, withered beneath the icy breath
of the destroyer. For autumn is nature’s chief executioner,
and its symbol is darkness. It has the temper of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
steel, and its symbol is a sharp sword. It is the avenging
angel, riding upon an atmosphere of death. As spring
is the epoch of growth, so autumn is the epoch of
maturity. And sad is the hour when maturity is passed,
for that which passes its prime must die.</p>

<p>“‘Still, what is this to plants and trees, which fade
away in their due season?... But stay; there is man,
man the divinest of all things. A hundred cares wreck
his heart, countless anxieties trace their wrinkles on his
brow, until his inmost self is bowed beneath the burden
of life. And swifter still he hurries to decay when vainly
striving to attain the unattainable, or grieving over his
ignorance of that which can never be known. Then
comes the whitening hair&mdash;and why not? Has man an
adamantine frame, that he should outlast the trees of the
field? Yet, after all, who is it, save himself, that steals
his strength away? Tell me, O boy, what right has man
to accuse his autumn blast?’</p>

<p>“My boy made no answer. He was fast asleep. No
sound reached me save that of the cricket chirping its
response to my dirge.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other leading historian of this period was <span class="smcap">Sung
Ch’i</span> (998-1061), who began his career by beating his
elder brother at the graduates’ examination. He was,
however, placed tenth, instead of first, by Imperial
command, and in accordance with the precedence of
brothers. He rose to high office, and was also a voluminous
writer. A great favourite at Court, it is related
that he was once at some Imperial festivity when he
began to feel cold. The Emperor bade one of the
ladies of the seraglio lend him a tippet, whereupon
about a dozen of the girls each offered hers. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Sung Ch’i did not like to seem to favour any one, and
rather than offend the rest, continued to sit and shiver.
The so-called New History of the T’ang Dynasty, which he
produced in co-operation with Ou-yang Hsiu, is generally
regarded as a distinct improvement upon the work of
Liu Hsü. It has not, however, actually superseded the
latter work, which is still included among the recognised
dynastic histories, and stands side by side with its rival.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SSŬ-MA KUANG</div>

<p>Meanwhile another star had risen, in magnitude to
be compared only with the effulgent genius of Ssŭ-ma
Ch’ien. <span class="smcap">Ssŭ-ma Kuang</span> (1019-1086) entered upon an
official career and rose to be Minister of State. But
he opposed the great reformer, Wang An-shih, and
in 1070 was compelled to resign. He devoted the rest
of his life to the completion of his famous work known
as the <cite>T’ung Chien</cite> or Mirror of History, a title bestowed
upon it in 1084 by the Emperor, because “to view antiquity
as it were in a mirror is an aid in the administration
of government.” The Mirror of History covers a
period from the fifth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> down to the beginning
of the Sung dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 960, and was supplemented by
several important works from the author’s own hand, all
bearing upon the subject. In his youth the latter had
been a devoted student, and used to rest his arm upon
a kind of round wooden pillow, which roused him to
wakefulness by its movement every time he began to
doze over his work. On one occasion, in childhood, a
small companion fell into a water-kong, and would have
been drowned but for the presence of mind of Ssŭ-ma
Kuang. He seized a huge stone, and with it cracked
the jar so that the water poured out. As a scholar he
had a large library, and was so particular in the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ling
of his books that even after many years’ use they
were still as good as new. He would not allow his
disciples to turn over leaves by scratching them up with
the nails, but made them use the forefinger and second
finger of the right hand. In 1085 he determined to
return to public life, but he had not been many months
in the capital, labouring as usual for his country’s
good, before he succumbed to an illness and died, universally
honoured and regretted by his countrymen, to
whom he was affectionately known as the Living Buddha.</p>

<p>The following extract from his writings refers to a new
and dangerous development in the Censorate, an institution
which still plays a singular part in the administration
of China:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Of old there was no such office as that of Censor.
From the highest statesman down to the artisan and
trader, every man was free to admonish the Throne.
From the time of the Han dynasty onwards, this
prerogative was vested in an office, with the weighty
responsibility of discussing the government of the
empire, the people within the Four Seas, successes,
failures, advantages, and disadvantages, in order of importance
and of urgency. The sole object in this
arrangement was the benefit of the State, not that of
the Censor, from whom all ideas of fame or gain were
indeed far removed. In 1017 an edict was issued
appointing six officers to undertake these Censorial
duties, and in 1045 their names were for the first time
written out on boards; and then, in 1062, apparently
for better preservation, the names were cut on stone.
Thus posterity can point to such an one and say,
‘There was a loyal man;’ to another, ‘There was a
traitor;’ to a third, ‘There was an upright man;’ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a fourth, ‘There was a scoundrel.’ Does not this give
cause for fear?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHOU TUN-I</div>

<p>Contemporaneously with Ssŭ-ma Kuang lived <span class="smcap">Chou
Tun-i</span> (1017-1073), who combined the duties of a small
military command with prolonged and arduous study.
He made himself ill by overwork and strict attention to
the interests of the people at all hazards to himself. His
chief works were written to elucidate the mysteries of
the Book of Changes, and were published after his death
by his disciples, with commentaries by Chu Hsi. The
following short satire, veiled under the symbolism of
flowers, being in a style which the educated Chinaman
most appreciates, is very widely known:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lovers of flowering plants and shrubs we have
had by scores, but T’ao Ch’ien alone devoted himself
to the chrysanthemum. Since the opening days of the
T’ang dynasty, it has been fashionable to admire the
peony; but my favourite is the water-lily. How stainless
it rises from its slimy bed! How modestly it reposes
on the clear pool&mdash;an emblem of purity and
truth! Symmetrically perfect, its subtle perfume is
wafted far and wide, while there it rests in spotless
state, something to be regarded reverently from a distance,
and not to be profaned by familiar approach.</p>

<p>“In my opinion the chrysanthemum is the flower
of retirement and culture; the peony the flower of
rank and wealth; the water-lily, the Lady Virtue <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans
pareille</i>.</p>

<p>“Alas! few have loved the chrysanthemum since
T’ao Ch’ien, and none now love the water-lily like
myself, whereas the peony is a general favourite with
all mankind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch’êng Hao</span> (1032-1085) and <span class="smcap">Ch’êng I</span> (1033-1107)
were two brothers famed for their scholarship, especially
the younger of the two, who published a valuable commentary
upon the Book of Changes. The elder attracted
some attention by boldly suppressing a stone image in a
Buddhist temple which was said to emit rays from its
head, and had been the cause of disorderly gatherings
of men and women. A specimen of his verse will be
given in the next chapter. Ch’êng I wrote some interesting
chapters on the art of poetry. In one of these he
says, “Asked if a man can make himself a poet by
taking pains, I reply that only by taking pains can any
one hope to be ranked as such, though on the other
hand the very fact of taking pains is likely to be inimical
to success. The old couplet reminds us&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘E’er one pentameter be spoken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many a human heart is broken!’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also another old couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘’Twere sad to take this heart of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And break it o’er a five-foot line.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both of these are very much to the point. Confucius
himself did not make verses, but he did not advise others
to abstain from doing so.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WANG AN-SHIH</div>

<p>The great reformer and political economist <span class="smcap">Wang
An-shih</span> (1021-1086), who lived to see all his policy
reversed, was a hard worker as a youth, and in composition
his pen was said to “fly over the paper.” As
a man he was distinguished by his frugality and his
obstinacy. He wore dirty clothes and did not even
wash his face, for which Su Hsün denounced him as a
beast. He was so cocksure of all his own views that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he would never admit the possibility of being wrong,
which gained for him the sobriquet of the Obstinate
Minister. He attempted to reform the examination
system, requiring from the candidate not so much graces
of style as a wide acquaintance with practical subjects.
“Accordingly,” says one Chinese writer, “even the pupils
at village schools threw away their text-books of rhetoric,
and began to study primers of history, geography, and
political economy.” He was the author of a work on
the written characters, with special reference to those
which are formed by the combination of two or more,
the meanings of which, taken together, determine the
meaning of the compound character. The following is
a letter which he wrote to a friend on the study of false
doctrines:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have been debarred by illness from writing to you
now for some time, though my thoughts have been with
you all the while.</p>

<p>“In reply to my last letter, wherein I expressed a fear
that you were not progressing with your study of the
Canon, I have received several from you, in all of which
you seem to think I meant the Canon of Buddha, and
you are astonished at my recommendation of such pernicious
works. But how could I possibly have intended
any other than the Canon of the sages of China? And
for you to have thus missed the point of my letter is a
good illustration of what I meant when I said I feared
you were not progressing with your study of the Canon.</p>

<p>“Now a thorough knowledge of our Canon has not
been attained by any one for a very long period.
Study of the Canon alone does not suffice for a
thorough knowledge of the Canon. Consequently,
I have been myself an omnivorous reader of books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of all kinds, even, for example, of ancient medical
and botanical works. I have, moreover, dipped into
treatises on agriculture and on needlework, all of which
I have found very profitable in aiding me to seize the
great scheme of the Canon itself. For learning in these
days is a totally different pursuit from what it was in the
olden times; and it is now impossible otherwise to get
at the real meaning of our ancient sages.</p>

<p>“There was Yang Hsiung. He hated all books that
were not orthodox. Yet he made a wide study of heterodox
writers. By force of education he was enabled to
take what of good and to reject what of bad he found
in each. Their pernicious influence was altogether lost
on him; while on the other hand he was prepared the
more effectively to elucidate what we know to be the
truth. Now, do you consider that I have been corrupted
by these pernicious influences? If so, you know me not.</p>

<p>“No! the pernicious influences of the age are not to
be sought for in the Canon of Buddha. They are to be
found in the corruption and vice of those in high places;
in the false and shameless conduct which is now rife
among us. Do you not agree with me?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SU SHIH</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Su Shih</span> (1036-1101), better known by his fancy name
as Su Tung-p’o, whose early education was superintended
by his mother, produced such excellent compositions
at the examination for his final degree that
the examiner, Ou-yang Hsiu, suspected them to be
the work of a qualified substitute. Ultimately he came
out first on the list. He rose to be a statesman,
who made more enemies than friends, and was perpetually
struggling against the machinations of unscrupulous
opponents, which on one occasion resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in his banishment to the island of Hainan, then a
barbarous and almost unknown region. He was also
a brilliant essayist and poet, and his writings are still
the delight of the Chinese. The following is an account
of a midnight picnic to a spot on the banks of a river
at which a great battle had taken place nearly nine
hundred years before, and where one of the opposing
fleets was burnt to the water’s edge, reddening a wall,
probably the cliff alongside:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the year 1081, the seventh moon just on the
wane, I went with a friend on a boat excursion to the
Red Wall. A clear breeze was gently blowing, scarce
enough to ruffle the river, as I filled my friend’s cup
and bade him troll a lay to the bright moon, singing the
song of the ‘Modest Maid.’</p>

<p>“By and by up rose the moon over the eastern
hills, wandering between the Wain and the Goat, shedding
forth her silver beams, and linking the water with
the sky. On a skiff we took our seats, and shot over the
liquid plain, lightly as though travelling through space,
riding on the wind without knowing whither we were
bound. We seemed to be moving in another sphere,
sailing through air like the gods. So I poured out a
bumper for joy, and, beating time on the skiff’s side,
sang the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘With laughing oars, our joyous prow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shoots swiftly through the glittering wave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My heart within grows sadly grave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great heroes dead, where are ye now?’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“My friend accompanied these words upon his flageolet,
delicately adjusting its notes to express the varied
emotions of pity and regret, without the slightest break
in the thread of sound which seemed to wind around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
us like a silken skein. The very monsters of the deep
yielded to the influence of his strains, while the boatwoman,
who had lost her husband, burst into a flood of
tears. Overpowered by my own feelings, I settled myself
into a serious mood, and asked my friend for some
explanation of his art. To this he replied, ‘Did not
Ts’ao Ts’ao say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The stars are few, the moon is bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raven southward wings his flight?’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“‘Westwards to Hsia-k’ou, eastwards to Wu-ch’ang,
where hill and stream in wild luxuriance blend,&mdash;was
it not there that Ts’ao Ts’ao was routed by Chou Yü?
Ching-chou was at his feet: he was pushing down
stream towards the east. His war-vessels stretched stem
to stern for a thousand <i>li</i>: his banners darkened the
sky. He poured out a libation as he neared Chiang-ling;
and, sitting in the saddle armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pie</i>, he
uttered those words, did that hero of his age. Yet
where is he to-day?</p>

<p>“‘Now you and I have fished and gathered fuel together
on the river eyots. We have fraternised with
the crayfish; we have made friends with the deer. We
have embarked together in our frail canoe; we have
drawn inspiration together from the wine-flask&mdash;a couple
of ephemerides launched on the ocean in a rice-husk!
Alas! life is but an instant of Time. I long to be like the
Great River which rolls on its way without end. Ah,
that I might cling to some angel’s wing and roam with
him for ever! Ah, that I might clasp the bright moon
in my arms and dwell with her for aye! Alas! it only
remains to me to enwrap these regrets in the tender
melody of sound.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘But do you forsooth comprehend,’ I inquired, ‘the
mystery of this river and of this moon? The water passes
by but is never gone: the moon wanes only to wax once
more. Relatively speaking, Time itself is but an instant
of time; absolutely speaking, you and I, in common with
all matter, shall exist to all eternity. Wherefore, then,
the longing of which you speak?</p>

<p>“‘The objects we see around us are one and all the
property of individuals. If a thing does not belong to
me, not a particle of it may be enjoyed by me. But the
clear breeze blowing across this stream, the bright moon
streaming over yon hills,&mdash;these are sounds and sights
to be enjoyed without let or hindrance by all. They are
the eternal gifts of God to all mankind, and their enjoyment
is inexhaustible. Hence it is that you and I are
enjoying them now.’</p>

<p>“My friend smiled as he threw away the dregs from
his wine-cup and filled it once more to the brim. And
then, when our feast was over, amid the litter of cups
and plates, we lay down to rest in the boat: for streaks
of light from the east had stolen upon us unawares.”</p>

<p>The completion of a pavilion which Su Shih had
been building, “as a refuge from the business of life,”
coinciding with a fall of rain which put an end to a
severe drought, elicited a grateful record of this divine
manifestation towards a suffering people. “The pavilion
was named after rain, to commemorate joy.” His record
concludes with these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Should Heaven rain pearls, the cold cannot wear them as clothes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should Heaven rain jade, the hungry cannot use it as food.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It has rained without cease for three days&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whose was the influence at work?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should you say it was that of your Governor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Governor himself refers it to the Son of Heaven.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But the Son of Heaven says ‘No! it was God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God says ‘No! it was Nature.’<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And as Nature lies beyond the ken of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I christen this arbour instead.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another piece refers to a recluse who&mdash;</p>

<p>“Kept a couple of cranes, which he had carefully
trained; and every morning he would release them westwards
through the gap, to fly away and alight in the
marsh below or soar aloft among the clouds as the birds’
own fancy might direct. At nightfall they would return
with the utmost regularity.”</p>

<p>This piece is also finished off with a few poetical
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Away! away! my birds, fly westwards now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wheel on high and gaze on all below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To swoop together, pinions closed, to earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soar aloft once more among the clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wander all day long in sedgy vale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather duckweed in the stony marsh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come back! come back! beneath the lengthening shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your serge-clad master stands, guitar in hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis he that feeds you from his slender store:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come back! come back! nor linger in the west.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His account of Sleep-Land is based upon the Drunk-Land
of Wang Chi:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A pure administration and admirable morals prevail
there, the whole being one vast level tract, with no
north, south, east, or west. The inhabitants are quiet
and affable; they suffer from no diseases of any kind,
neither are they subject to the influences of the seven
passions. They have no concern with the ordinary
affairs of life; they do not distinguish heaven, earth,
the sun, and the moon; they toil not, neither do they
spin; but simply lie down and enjoy themselves. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
have no ships and no carriages; their wanderings, however,
are the boundless flights of the imagination.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His younger brother, <span class="smcap">Su Chê</span> (1039-1112), poet and
official, is chiefly known for his devotion to Taoism.
He published an edition, with commentary, of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUANG T’ING-CHIEN</div>

<p>One of the Four Scholars of his century is <span class="smcap">Huang
T’ing-chien</span> (1050-1110), who was distinguished as a
poet and a calligraphist. He has also been placed
among the twenty-four examples of filial piety, for when
his mother was ill he watched by her bedside for a whole
year without ever taking off his clothes. The following
is a specimen of his epistolary style:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hsi K’ang’s verses are at once vigorous and purely
beautiful, without a vestige of commonplace about
them. Every student of the poetic art should know
them thoroughly, and thus bring the author into his
mind’s eye.</p>

<p>“Those who are sunk in the cares and anxieties of
this world’s strife, even by a passing glance would gain
therefrom enough to clear away some pecks of the cobwebs
of mortality. How much more they who penetrate
further and seize each hidden meaning and enjoy its
flavour to the full? Therefore, my nephew, I send you
these poems for family reading, that you may cleanse
your heart and solace a weary hour by their perusal.</p>

<p>“As I recently observed to my own young people, the
true hero should be many-sided, but he must not be
commonplace. It is impossible to cure that. Upon
which one of them asked by what characteristics this
absence of the commonplace was distinguished. ‘It is
hard to say,’ I replied. ‘A man who is not common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>place
is, under ordinary circumstances, much like other
people. But he who at moments of great trial does not
flinch, he is not commonplace.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chêng Ch’iao</span> (1108-1166) began his literary career
in studious seclusion, cut off from all human intercourse.
Then he spent some time in visiting various
places of interest, devoting himself to searching out
marvels, investigating antiquities, and reading (and remembering)
every book that came in his way. In
1149 he was summoned to an audience, and received an
honorary post. He was then sent home to copy out his
History of China, which covered a period from about
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 2800 to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 600. A fine edition of this work, in
forty-six large volumes, was published in 1749 by
Imperial command, with a preface by the Emperor
Ch’ien Lung. He also wrote essays and poetry, besides
a treatise in which he showed that the inscriptions on
the Stone Drums, now in Peking, belong rather to the
latter half of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> than to the tenth or
eleventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, as usually accepted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHU HSI</div>

<p>The name of <span class="smcap">Chu Hsi</span> (1130-1200) is a household
word throughout the length and breadth of literary
China. He graduated at nineteen, and entered upon a
highly successful official career. He apparently had a
strong leaning towards Buddhism&mdash;some say that he
actually became a Buddhist priest; at any rate, he soon
saw the error of his ways, and gave himself up completely
to a study of the orthodox doctrine. He was
a most voluminous writer. In addition to his revision
of the history of Ssŭ-ma Kuang, which, under the
title of <cite>T’ung Chien Kang Mu</cite>, is still regarded as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
standard history of China, he placed himself first in the
first rank of all commentators on the Confucian Canon.
He introduced interpretations either wholly or partly
at variance with those which had been put forth by the
scholars of the Han dynasty and hitherto received as
infallible, thus modifying to a certain extent the prevailing
standard of political and social morality. His
principle was simply one of consistency. He refused to
interpret words in a given passage in one sense, and the
same words occurring elsewhere in another sense. The
result, as a whole, was undoubtedly to quicken with
intelligibility many paragraphs the meaning of which
had been obscured rather than elucidated by the earlier
scholars of the Han dynasty. Occasionally, however,
the great commentator o’erleapt himself. Here are
two versions of one passage in the Analects, as interpreted
by the rival schools, of which the older seems
unquestionably to be preferred:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Han.</em></p>

<p>Mêng Wu asked Confucius
concerning filial piety. The
Master said, “It consists in
giving your parents no cause for
anxiety save from your natural
ailments.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Chu Hsi.</em></p>

<p>Mêng Wu asked Confucius
concerning filial piety. The
Master said, “Parents have the
sorrow of thinking anxiously
about their children’s ailments.”</p></div>

<p>The latter of these interpretations being obviously
incomplete, Chu Hsi adds a gloss to the effect that
children are therefore in duty bound to take great care
of themselves.</p>

<p>In the preface to his work on the Four Books as
explained by Chu Hsi, published in 1745, Wang Pu-ch’ing
(born 1671) has the following passage:&mdash;“Shao
Yung tried to explain the Canon of Changes by num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>bers,
and Ch’êng I by the eternal fitness of things; but
Chu Hsi alone was able to pierce through the meaning,
and appropriate the thought of the prophets who composed
it.” The other best known works of Chu Hsi are
a metaphysical treatise containing the essence of his later
speculations, and the Little Learning, a handbook for
the young. It has been contended by some that the
word “little” in the last title refers not to youthful
learners, but to the lower plane on which the book
is written, as compared with the Great Learning. The
following extract, however, seems to point more towards
Learning for the Young as the correct rendering
of the title:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When mounting the wall of a city, do not point with
the finger; when on the top, do not call out.</p>

<p>“When at a friend’s house, do not persist in asking
for anything you may wish to have. When going upstairs,
utter a loud ‘Ahem!’ If you see two pairs of
shoes outside and hear voices, you may go in; but if
you hear nothing, remain outside. Do not trample on
the shoes of other guests, nor step on the mat spread for
food; but pick up your skirts and pass quickly to your
allotted place. Do not be in a hurry to arrive, nor in
haste to get away.</p>

<p>“Do not bother the gods with too many prayers. Do
not make allowances for your own shortcomings. Do
not seek to know what has not yet come to pass.”</p>

<p>Chu Hsi was lucky enough to fall in with a clever
portrait painter, a <i>rara avis</i> in China at the present day
according to Mr. J. B. Coughtrie, late of Hongkong, who
declares that “the style and taste peculiar to the Chinese
combine to render a lifelike resemblance impossible,
and the completed picture unattractive. The artist lays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
upon his paper a flat wash of colour to match the complexion
of his sitter, and upon this draws a mere map of
the features, making no attempt to obtain roundness or
relief by depicting light and shadows, and never by any
chance conveying the slightest suggestion of animation
or expression.” Chu Hsi gave the artist a glowing
testimonial, in which he states that the latter not merely
portrays the features, but “catches the very expression,
and reproduces, as it were, the inmost mind of his
model.” He then adds the following personal tit-bit:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I myself sat for two portraits, one large and the
other small; and it was quite a joke to see how accurately
he reproduced my coarse ugly face and my
vulgar rustic turn of mind, so that even those who had
only heard of, but had never seen me, knew at once for
whom the portraits were intended.” It would be interesting
to know if either of these pictures still survives
among the Chu family heirlooms.</p>

<p>At the death of Chu Hsi, his coffin is said to have
taken up a position, suspended in the air, about three
feet from the ground. Whereupon his son-in-law,
falling on his knees beside the bier, reminded the
departed spirit of the great principles of which he had
been such a brilliant exponent in life,&mdash;and the coffin
descended gently to the ground.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

POETRY</h3>


<p>The poetry of the Sungs has not attracted so much
attention as that of the T’angs. This is chiefly due to
the fact that although all the literary men of the Sung
dynasty may roughly be said to have contributed their
quota of verse, still there were few, if any, who could
be ranked as professional poets, that is, as writers of
verse and of nothing else, like Li Po, Tu Fu, and many
others under the T’ang dynasty. Poetry now began to be,
what it has remained in a marked degree until the present
day, a department of polite education, irrespective of
the particle of the divine gale. More regard was paid
to form, and the license which had been accorded to
earlier masters was sacrificed to conventionality. The
Odes collected by Confucius are, as we have seen, rude
ballads of love, and war, and tilth, borne by their very
simplicity direct to the human heart. The poetry of the
T’ang dynasty shows a masterly combination, in which
art, unseen, is employed to enhance, not to fetter and
degrade, thoughts drawn from a veritable communion
with nature. With the fall of the T’ang dynasty the
poetic art suffered a lapse from which it has never
recovered; and now, in modern times, although every
student “can turn a verse” because he has been “duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
taught,” the poems produced disclose a naked artificiality
which leaves the reader disappointed and cold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CH’ÊN T’UAN</div>

<p>The poet <span class="smcap">Ch’ên T’uan</span> (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 989) began life under
favourable auspices. He was suckled by a mysterious
lady in a green robe, who found him playing as a tiny
child on the bank of a river. He became, in consequence
of this supernatural nourishment, exceedingly clever and
possessed of a prodigious memory, with a happy knack
for verse. Yet he failed to get a degree, and gave himself
up “to the joys of hill and stream.” While on
the mountains some spiritual beings are said to have
taught him the art of hibernating like an animal, so
that he would go off to sleep for a hundred days at a
time. He wrote a treatise on the elixir of life, and was
generally inclined to Taoist notions. At death his body
remained warm for seven days, and for a whole month a
“glory” played around his tomb. He was summoned
several times to Court, but to judge by the following
poem, officialdom seems to have had few charms for
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For ten long years I plodded through<br /></span>
<span class="i10">the vale of lust and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through my dreams there flashed a ray<br /></span>
<span class="i10">of the old sweet peaceful life....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No scarlet-tasselled hat of state<br /></span>
<span class="i10">can vie with soft repose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grand mansions do not taste the joys<br /></span>
<span class="i10">that the poor man’s cabin knows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hate the threatening clash of arms<br /></span>
<span class="i10">when fierce retainers throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I loathe the drunkard’s revels and<br /></span>
<span class="i10">the sound of fife and song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I love to seek a quiet nook, and<br /></span>
<span class="i10">some old volume bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I can see the wild flowers bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i10">and hear the birds in spring.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>Another poet, <span class="smcap">Yang I</span> (974-1030), was unable to speak
as a child, until one day, being taken to the top of a
pagoda, he suddenly burst out with the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Upon this tall pagoda’s peak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My hand can nigh the stars enclose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dare not raise my voice to speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For fear of startling God’s repose.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mention has already been made of <span class="smcap">Shao Yung</span> (1011-1077)
in connection with Chu Hsi and classical scholarship.
He was a great traveller, and an enthusiast in
the cause of learning. He denied himself a stove in
winter and a fan in summer. For thirty years he did not
use a pillow, nor had he even a mat to sleep on. The
following specimen of his verse seems, however, to belie
his character as an ascetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fair flowers from above in my goblet are shining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And add by reflection an infinite zest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through two generations I’ve lived unrepining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While four mighty rulers have sunk to their rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“My body in health has done nothing to spite me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet are the moments which pass o’er my head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, with this wine and these flowers to delight me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I keep sober and get home to bed?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shao Yung was a great authority on natural phenomena,
the explanation of which he deduced from principles
found in the Book of Changes. On one occasion
he was strolling about with some friends when he heard
the goatsucker’s cry. He immediately became depressed,
and said, “When good government is about to prevail,
the magnetic current flows from north to south; when
bad government is about to prevail, it flows from south
to north, and birds feel its influence first of all things.
Now hitherto this bird has not been seen at Lo-yang;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
from which I infer that the magnetic current is flowing
from south to north, and that some southerner is coming
into power, with manifold consequences to the State.”
The subsequent appearance of Wang An-shih was regarded
as a verification of his skill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANG AN-SHIH</div>

<p>The great reformer here mentioned found time, amid
the cares of his economic revolution, to indulge in
poetical composition. Here is his account of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nuit
blanche</i>, an excellent example of the difficult “stop-short:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The incense-stick is burnt to ash,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Here, too, is a short poem by the classical scholar,
Huang T’ing-chien, written on the annual visit for worship
at the tombs of ancestors, in full view of the hillside
cemetery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The grave student Ch’êng Hao wrote verses like the
rest. Sometimes he even condescended to jest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I wander north, I wander south,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">the river-banks lay bare?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loss of hue to river-banks<br /></span>

<p>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries <span class="smcap">Hung Chüeh-fan</span>
made a name for himself as a poet and calligraphist,
but he finally yielded to the fascination of Buddhism
and took orders as a priest. This is no trifling ordeal.
From three to nine pastilles are placed upon the
shaven scalp of the candidate, and are allowed to burn

<h3>CHAPTER IV
<br />

DICTIONARIES&mdash;ENCYCLOPÆDIAS&mdash;MEDICAL
JURISPRUDENCE</h3>


<p>Several dictionaries of importance were issued by
various scholars during the Sung dynasty, not to
mention many philological works of more or less
value. The Chinese have always been students of
their own language, partly, no doubt, because they
have so far never condescended to look at any other.
They delight in going back to days when correspondence
was carried on by pictures pure and simple;
and the fact that there is little evidence forthcoming
that such a system ever prevailed has only resulted
in stimulating invention and forgery.</p>

<p>A clever courtier, popularly known as “the nine-tailed
fox,” was <span class="smcap">Ch’ên P’êng-nien</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 961&mdash;1017), who rose
to be a Minister of State. He was employed to revise
the <cite>Kuang Yün</cite>, a phonetic dictionary by some unknown
author, which contained over 26,000 separate characters.
This work was to a great extent superseded by the <cite>Chi
Yün</cite>, on a similar plan, but containing over 53,000
characters. The latter was produced by Sung Ch’i,
mentioned in chap. iii., in conjunction with several
eminent scholars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tai T’ung</span> graduated in 1237 and rose to be Governor
of T’ai-chou in Chehkiang. Then the Mongols pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>vailed,
and Tai T’ung, unwilling to serve them, pleaded
ill-health, and in 1275 retired into private life. There
he occupied himself with the composition of the <cite>Liu Shu
Ku</cite> or Six Scripts, an examination into the origin and
development of writing, which, according to some, was
published about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1250, but according to others, not
until so late as the year 1319.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WU SHU&mdash;LI FANG</div>

<p>From the rise of the Sung dynasty may be dated the
first appearance of the encyclopædia, destined to occupy
later so much space in Chinese literature. <span class="smcap">Wu Shu</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
947&mdash;1002), whose life was a good instance of “worth by
poverty depressed,” may fairly be credited with the
production of the earliest work of the kind. His <cite>Shih
Lei Fu</cite> dealt with celestial and terrestrial phenomena,
mineralogy, botany, and natural history, arranged, for
want of an alphabet, under categories. It is curiously
written in the poetical-prose style, and forms the foundation
of a similar book of reference in use at the present
day. Wu Shu was placed upon the commission which
produced a much more extensive work known as the
<cite>T’ai P’ing Yü Lan</cite>. At the head of that commission was
<span class="smcap">Li Fang</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 924&mdash;995), a Minister of State and a great
favourite with the Emperor. In the last year of his life
he was invited to witness the Feast of Lanterns from the
palace. On that occasion the Emperor placed Li beside
him, and after pouring out for him a goblet of wine and
supplying him with various delicacies, he turned to his
courtiers and said, “Li Fang has twice served us as
Minister of State, yet has he never in any way injured
a single fellow-creature. Truly this must be a virtuous
man.” The <cite>T’ai P’ing Yü Lan</cite> was reprinted in 1812,
and is bound up in thirty-two large volumes. It was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
named because the Emperor himself went through all
the manuscript, a task which occupied him nearly a year.
A list of about eight hundred authorities is given, and
the Index fills four hundred pages.</p>

<p>As a pendant to this work Li Fang designed the <cite>T’ai
P’ing Kuang Chi</cite>, an encyclopædia of biographical and
other information drawn from general literature. A list
of about three hundred and sixty authorities is given,
and the Index fills two hundred and eighty pages. The
edition of 1566&mdash;a rare work&mdash;bound up in twelve thick
volumes, stands upon the shelves of the Cambridge
University Library.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another encyclopædist was <span class="smcap">Ma Tuan-lin</span>, the son of a
high official, in whose steps he prepared to follow. The
dates of his birth and death are not known, but he
flourished in the thirteenth century. Upon the collapse
of the Sung dynasty he disappeared from public life,
and taking refuge in his native place, he gave himself
up to teaching, attracting many disciples from far and
near, and fascinating all by his untiring dialectic skill.
He left behind him the <cite>Wên Hsien T’ung K’ao</cite>, a large
encyclopædia based upon the <cite>T’ung Tien</cite> of Tu Yu,
but much enlarged and supplemented by five additional
sections, namely, Bibliography, Imperial Lineage, Appointments,
Uranography, and Natural Phenomena.
This work, which cost its author twenty years of unremitting
labour, has long been known to Europeans,
who have drawn largely upon its ample stores of antiquarian
research.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE HSI YÜAN LU</div>

<p>At the close of the Sung dynasty there was published
a curious book on Medical Jurisprudence, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
interesting, in spite of its manifold absurdities, as being
the recognised handbook for official use at the present
day. No magistrate ever thinks of proceeding to discharge
the duties of coroner without taking a copy of
these instructions along with him. The present work
was compiled by a judge named Sung Tz’ŭ, from pre-existing
works of a similar kind, and we are told in the
preface of a fine edition, dated 1842, that “being subjected
for many generations to practical tests by the
officers of the Board of Punishments, it became daily
more and more exact.” A few extracts will be sufficient
to determine its real value:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) “Man has three hundred and sixty-five bones, corresponding
to the number of days it takes the heavens
to revolve.</p>

<p>“The skull of a male, from the nape of the neck to the
top of the head, consists of eight pieces&mdash;of a Ts’ai-chou
man, nine. There is a horizontal suture across the back
of the skull, and a perpendicular one down the middle.
Female skulls are of six pieces, and have the horizontal
but not the perpendicular suture.</p>

<p>“Teeth are twenty-four, twenty-eight, thirty-two, or
thirty-six in number. There are three long-shaped breast-bones.</p>

<p>“There is one bone belonging to the heart of the
shape and size of a <i>cash</i>.</p>

<p>“There is one ‘shoulder-well’ bone and one ‘rice-spoon’
bone on each side.</p>

<p>“Males have twelve ribs on each side, eight long and
four short. Females have fourteen on each side.”</p>

<p>(2.) “Wounds inflicted on the bone leave a red mark
and a slight appearance of saturation, and where the bone
is broken there will be at each end a halo-like trace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
blood. Take a bone on which there are marks of a
wound, and hold it up to the light; if these are of a
fresh-looking red, the wound was inflicted before death
and penetrated to the bone; but if there is no trace of
saturation from blood, although there is a wound, it was
inflicted after death.”</p>

<p>(3.) “The bones of parents may be identified by their
children in the following manner. Let the experimenter
cut himself or herself with a knife, and cause the blood to
drip on to the bones; then if the relationship is an actual
fact, the blood will sink into the bone, otherwise it will
not. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Should the bones have been washed with salt
water, even though the relationship exists, yet the blood
will not soak in. This is a trick to be guarded against
beforehand.</p>

<p>“It is also said that if parent and child, or husband
and wife, each cut themselves and let the blood drip into
a basin of water, the two bloods will mix, whereas that of
two people not thus related will not mix.</p>

<p>“Where two brothers, who may have been separated
since childhood, are desirous of establishing their identity
as such, but are unable to do so by ordinary means, bid
each one cut himself and let the blood drip into a basin.
If they are really brothers, the two bloods will coagulate
into one; otherwise not. But because fresh blood
will always coagulate with the aid of a little salt or
vinegar, people often smear the basin over with these
to attain their own ends and deceive others; therefore
always wash out the basin you are going to use, or buy
a new one from a shop. Thus the trick will be defeated.”</p>

<p>(4.) “There are some atrocious villains who, when
they have murdered any one, burn the body and throw
the ashes away, so that there are no bones to examine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
In such cases you must carefully find out at what time
the murder was committed, and where the body was
burnt. Then, when you know the place, all witnesses
agreeing on this point, you may proceed without further
delay to examine the wounds. The mode of procedure
is this. Put up your shed near where the body was
burnt, and make the accused and witnesses point out
themselves the exact spot. Then cut down the grass and
weeds growing on this spot, and burn large quantities of
fuel till the place is extremely hot, throwing on several
pecks of hemp-seed. By and by brush the place clean;
then, if the body was actually burnt on this spot, the oil
from the seed will be found to have sunk into the ground
in the form of a human figure, and wherever there were
wounds on the dead man, there on this figure the oil
will be found to have collected together, large or small,
square, round, long, short, oblique, or straight, exactly as
they were inflicted. The parts where there were no
wounds will be free from any such appearances.”</p>

<h2>BOOK THE SIXTH<br />

<span class="smaller">
<i>THE MONGOL DYNASTY</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1200-1368)</span></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE&mdash;POETRY</h3>


<p>The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries witnessed a
remarkable political revolution. China was conquered
by the Mongols, and for the first time in history the
empire passed under the rule of an alien sovereign. No
exact date can be assigned for the transference of the
Imperial power. In 1264 Kublai Khan fixed his capital
at Peking, and in 1271 he adopted Yüan as his dynastic
style. It was not, however, until 1279 that the patriot
statesman, Chao Ping, had his retreat cut off, and despairing
of his country, took upon his back the boy-Emperor,
the last of the Sungs, and jumped from his
doomed vessel into the river, thus bringing the great fire-led
dynasty to an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WÊN T’IEN-HSIANG</div>

<p>Kublai Khan, who was a confirmed Buddhist, paid
great honour to Confucius, and was a steady patron of
literature. In 1269 he caused Bashpa, a Tibetan priest,
to construct an alphabet for the Mongol language; in
1280 the calendar was revised; and in 1287 the Impe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>rial
Academy was opened. But he could not forgive
<span class="smcap">Wên T’ien-hsiang</span> (1236-1283), the renowned patriot and
scholar, who had fought so bravely but unsuccessfully
against him. In 1279 the latter was conveyed to Peking,
on which journey he passed eight days without eating.
Every effort was made to induce him to own allegiance
to the Mongol Emperor, but without success. He was
kept in prison for three years. At length he was summoned
into the presence of Kublai Khan, who said to
him, “What is it you want?” “By the grace of the
Sung Emperor,” Wên T’ien-hsiang replied, “I became his
Majesty’s Minister. I cannot serve two masters. I only
ask to die.” Accordingly he was executed, meeting his
death with composure, and making a final obeisance
southwards, as though his own sovereign was still reigning
in his own capital. The following poem was written
by Wên T’ien-hsiang while in captivity:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is in the universe an Aura which permeates all
things and makes them what they are. Below, it shapes
forth land and water; above, the sun and the stars. In
man it is called spirit; and there is nowhere where it is
not.</p>

<p>“In times of national tranquillity this spirit lies <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</i> in
the harmony which prevails; only at some great crisis
is it manifested widely abroad.”</p>

<p>[Here follow ten historical instances of devotion and
heroism.]</p>

<p>“Such is this grand and glorious spirit which endureth
for all generations, and which, linked with the sun and
the moon, knows neither beginning nor end. The foundation
of all that is great and good in heaven and earth,
it is itself born from the everlasting obligations which
are due by man to man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alas! the fates were against me. I was without
resource. Bound with fetters, hurried away towards
the north, death would have been sweet indeed; but
that boon was refused.</p>

<p>“My dungeon is lighted by the will-o’-the-wisp alone;
no breath of spring cheers the murky solitude in which
I dwell. The ox and the barb herd together in one
stall, the rooster and the phœnix feed together from one
dish. Exposed to mist and dew, I had many times
thought to die; and yet, through the seasons of two
revolving years, disease hovered round me in vain. The
dank, unhealthy soil to me became paradise itself. For
there was that within me which misfortune could not
steal away. And so I remained firm, gazing at the white
clouds floating over my head, and bearing in my heart
a sorrow boundless as the sky.</p>

<p>“The sun of those dead heroes has long since set, but
their record is before me still. And, while the wind
whistles under the eaves, I open my books and read;
and lo! in their presence my heart glows with a borrowed
fire.”</p>

<p>“I myself,” adds the famous commentator, Lin Hsi-chung,
of the seventeenth century, “in consequence of the
rebellion in Fuhkien, lay in prison for two years, while
deadly disease raged around. Daily I recited this poem
several times over, and happily escaped; from which it
is clear that the supremest efforts in literature move even
the gods, and that it is not the verses of Tu Fu alone
which can prevail against malarial fever.”</p>

<p>At the final examination for his degree in 1256, Wên
T’ien-hsiang had been placed seventh on the list. However,
the then Emperor, on looking over the papers of
the candidates before the result was announced, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
immensely struck by his work, and sent for the grand
examiner to reconsider the order of merit. “This
essay,” said his Majesty, “shows us the moral code of
the ancients as in a mirror; it betokens a loyalty enduring
as iron and stone.” The grand examiner readily
admitted the justice of the Emperor’s criticism, and
when the list was published, the name of Wên T’ien-hsiang
stood first. The fame of that examiner, <span class="smcap">Wang
Ying-lin</span> (1223-1296), is likely to last for a long time to
come. Not because of his association with one of
China’s greatest patriots, nor because of his voluminous
contributions to classical literature, including an extensive
encyclopædia, a rare copy of which is to be seen in
the University of Leyden, but because of a small primer
for schoolboys, which, by almost universal consent, is
attributed to his pen. For six hundred years this
primer has been, and is still at this moment, the first
book put into the hand of every child throughout the
empire. It is an epitome of all knowledge, dealing
with philosophy, classical literature, history, biography,
and common objects. It has been called a sleeve
edition of the Mirror of History. Written in lines
of three characters to each, and being in doggerel
rhyme, it is easily committed to memory, and is known
by heart by every Chinaman who has learnt to read.
This Three Character Classic, as it is called, has been imitated
by Christian missionaries, Protestant and Catholic;
and even the T’ai-p’ing rebels, alive to its far-reaching influence,
published an imitation of their own. Here are
a few specimen lines, rhymed to match the original:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Men, one and all, in infancy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are virtuous at heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their moral tendencies the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their practice wide apart.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Without instruction’s kindly aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man’s nature grows less fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In teaching, thoroughness should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A never-ceasing care.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be added that the meaning of the Three
Character Classic is not explained to the child at the
time. All that the latter has to do is to learn the sounds
and formation of the 560 different characters of which
the book is composed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LIU YIN</div>

<p>A clever boy, who attracted much attention by
the filial piety which he displayed towards his stepfather,
was <span class="smcap">Liu Yin</span> (1241-1293). He obtained office,
but resigned in order to tend his sick mother; and
when again appointed, his health broke down and he
went into seclusion. The following extract is from his
pen:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When God made man, He gave him powers to cope
with the exigencies of his environment, and resources
within himself, so that he need not be dependent upon
external circumstances.</p>

<p>“Thus, in districts where poisons abound, antidotes
abound also; and in others, where malaria prevails, we
find such correctives as ginger, nutmegs, and dogwood.
Again, fish, terrapins, and clams are the most wholesome
articles of diet in excessively damp climates,
though themselves denizens of the water; and musk
and deer-horns are excellent prophylactics in earthy
climates, where in fact they are produced. For if these
things were unable to prevail against their surroundings,
they could not possibly thrive where they do, while the
fact that they do so thrive is proof positive that they
were ordained as specifics against those surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Chu Hsi said, ‘When God is about to send down
calamities upon us, He first raises up the hero whose
genius shall finally prevail against those calamities.’
From this point of view there can be no living man
without his appointed use, nor any state of society
which man should be unable to put right.”</p>

<p>The theory that every man plays his allotted part in
the cosmos is a favourite one with the Chinese; and the
process by which the tares are separated from the
wheat, exemplifying the use of adversity, has been
curiously stated by a Buddhist priest of this date:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If one is a man, the mills of heaven and earth grind
him to perfection; if not, to destruction.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A considerable amount of poetry was produced under
the Mongol sway, though not so much proportionately,
nor of such a high order, as under the great native
dynasties. The Emperor Ch’ien Lung published in 1787 a
collection of specimens of the poetry of this Yüan dynasty.
They fill eight large volumes, but are not much read.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIU CHI</div>

<p>One of the best known poets of this period is <span class="smcap">Liu
Chi</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1311-1375), who was also deeply read in the
Classics and also a student of astrology. He lived
into the Ming dynasty, which he helped to establish, and
was for some years the trusted adviser of its first ruler.
He lost favour, however, and was poisoned by a rival, it
is said, with the Emperor’s connivance. The following
lines, referring to an early visit to a mountain monastery,
reveal a certain sympathy with Buddhism:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I mounted when the cock had just begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reached the convent ere the bells were done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle zephyr whispered o’er the lawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the wood the moon gave way to dawn.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And in this pure sweet solitude I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching my limbs out to await the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound along the willow pathway dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the soft echo of the bonzes’ hymn.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here too is an oft-quoted stanza, to be found in any
poetry primer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A centenarian ’mongst men<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon the hillside sleep at last.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The prose writings of Liu Chi are much admired for
their pure style, which has been said to “smell of
antiquity.” One piece tells how a certain noble who
had lost all by the fall of the Ch’in dynasty, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 206,
and was forced to grow melons for a living, had recourse
to divination, and went to consult a famous augur on
his prospects.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the augur, “what is there that Heaven
can bestow save that which virtue can obtain? Where
is the efficacy of spiritual beings beyond that with which
man has endowed them? The divining plant is but a
dead stalk; the tortoise-shell a dry bone. They are but
matter like ourselves. And man, the divinest of all
things, why does he not seek wisdom from within, rather
than from these grosser stuffs?</p>

<p>“Besides, sir, why not reflect upon the past&mdash;that past
which gave birth to this present? Your cracked roof
and crumbling walls of to-day are but the complement
of yesterday’s lofty towers and spacious halls. The
straggling bramble is but the complement of the shapely
garden tree. The grasshopper and the cicada are but
the complement of organs and flutes; the will-o’-the-wisp
and firefly, of gilded lamps and painted candles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Your endive and watercresses are but the complement
of the elephant-sinews and camel’s hump of days bygone;
the maple-leaf and the rush, of your once rich
robes and fine attire. Do not repine that those who had
not such luxuries then enjoy them now. Do not be
dissatisfied that you, who enjoyed them then, have them
now no more. In the space of a day and night the
flower blooms and dies. Between spring and autumn
things perish and are renewed. Beneath the roaring
cascade a deep pool is found; dark valleys lie at the foot
of high hills. These things you know; what more can
divination teach you?”</p>

<p>Another piece is entitled “Outsides,” and is a light
satire on the corruption of his day:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At Hangchow there lived a costermonger who
understood how to keep oranges a whole year without
letting them spoil. His fruit was always fresh-looking,
firm as jade, and of a beautiful golden hue; but inside&mdash;dry
as an old cocoon.</p>

<p>“One day I asked him, saying, ‘Are your oranges for
altar or sacrificial purposes, or for show at banquets?
Or do you make this outside display merely to cheat the
foolish? as cheat them you most outrageously do.’
‘Sir,’ replied the orangeman, ‘I have carried on this
trade now for many years. It is my source of livelihood.
I sell; the world buys. And I have yet to learn that
you are the only honest man about, and that I am the
only cheat. Perhaps it never struck you in this light.
The bâton-bearers of to-day, seated on their tiger skins,
pose as the martial guardians of the State; but what are
they compared with the captains of old? The broad-brimmed,
long-robed Ministers of to-day pose as pillars
of the constitution; but have they the wisdom of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ancient counsellors? Evil-doers arise, and none can
subdue them. The people are in misery, and none can
relieve them. Clerks are corrupt, and none can restrain
them. Laws decay, and none can renew them. Our
officials eat the bread of the State and know no shame.
They sit in lofty halls, ride fine steeds, drink themselves
drunk with wine, and batten on the richest fare. Which
of them but puts on an awe-inspiring look, a dignified
mien?&mdash;all gold and gems without, but dry cocoons
within. You pay, sir, no heed to these things, while you
are very particular about my oranges.’</p>

<p>“I had no answer to make. Was he really out of
conceit with the age, or only quizzing me in defence of
his fruit?”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

THE DRAMA</h3>


<div class="sidenote">THE DRAMA</div>

<p>If the Mongol dynasty added little of permanent value
to the already vast masses of poetry, of general literature,
and of classical exegesis, it will ever be remembered in
connection with two important departures in the literary
history of the nation. Within the century covered by
Mongol rule the Drama and the Novel may be said to
have come into existence. Going back to pre-Confucian
or legendary days, we find that from time immemorial
the Chinese have danced set dances in time to music on
solemn or festive occasions of sacrifice or ceremony.
Thus we read in the Odes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lightly, sprightly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the dance I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun shining brightly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the court below.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The movements of the dancers were methodical, slow,
and dignified. Long feathers and flutes were held in the
hand and were waved to and fro as the performers
moved right or left. Words to be sung were added, and
then gradually the music and singing prevailed over the
dance, gesture being substituted. The result was rather
an operatic than a dramatic performance, and the words
sung were more of the nature of songs than of musical
plays. In the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, under <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 545, we read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of an amateur attempt of the kind, organised by stable-boys,
which frightened their horses and caused a stampede.
Confucius, too, mentions the arrogance of a
noble who employed in his ancestral temple the number
of singers reserved for the Son of Heaven alone. It is
hardly necessary to allude to the exorcism of evil spirits,
carried out three times a year by officials dressed up in
bearskins and armed with spear and shield, who made a
house to house visitation surrounded by a shouting and
excited populace. It is only mentioned here because
some writers have associated this practice with the origin
of the drama in China. All we really know is that in
very early ages music and song and dance formed an
ordinary accompaniment to religious and other ceremonies,
and that this continued for many centuries.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the eighth century, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
the Emperor Ming Huang of the T’ang dynasty,
being exceedingly fond of music, established a College,
known as the Pear-Garden, for training some three
hundred young people of both sexes. There is a
legend that this College was the outcome of a visit paid
by his Majesty to the moon, where he was much impressed
by a troup of skilled performers attached to the
Palace of Jade which he found there. It was apparently
an institution to provide instrumentalists, vocalists, and
possibly dancers, for Court entertainments, although
some have held that the “youths of the Pear-Garden”
were really actors, and the term is still applied to the
dramatic fraternity. Nothing, however, which can be
truly identified with the actor’s art seems to have been
known until the thirteenth century, when suddenly the
Drama, as seen in the modern Chinese stage-play, sprang
into being. In the present limited state of our know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>ledge
on the subject, it is impossible to say how or why
this came about. We cannot trace step by step the
development of the drama in China from a purely choral
performance, as in Greece. We are simply confronted
with the accomplished fact.</p>

<p>At the same time we hear of dramatic performances
among the Tartars at a somewhat earlier date. In 1031
K’ung Tao-fu, a descendant of Confucius in the forty-fifth
degree, was sent as envoy to the Kitans, and was
received at a banquet with much honour. But at a
theatrical entertainment which followed, a piece was
played in which his sacred ancestor, Confucius, was
introduced as the low-comedy man; and this so disgusted
him that he got up and withdrew, the Kitans
being forced to apologise. Altogether, it would seem
that the drama is not indigenous to China, but may well
have been introduced from Tartar sources. However
this may be, it is certain that the drama as known under
the Mongols is to all intents and purposes the drama of
to-day, and a few general remarks may not be out of place.</p>

<p>Plays are acted in the large cities of China at public
theatres all the year round, except during one month at
the New Year, and during the period of mourning for a
deceased Emperor. There is no charge for admission,
but all visitors must take some refreshment. The various
Trade-Guilds have raised stages upon their premises,
and give periodical performances free to all who will
stand in an open-air courtyard to watch them. Mandarins
and wealthy persons often engage actors to
perform in their private houses, generally while a
dinner-party is going on. In the country, performances
are provided by public subscription, and take place at
temples or on temporary stages put up in the roadway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
These stages are always essentially the same. There is
no curtain, there are no wings, and no flies. At the
back of the stage are two doors, one for entrance and
one for exit. The actors who are to perform the first
piece come in by the entrance door all together. When
the piece is over, and as they are filing out through the
exit door, those who are cast for the second piece pass
in through the other door. There is no interval, and the
musicians, who sit on the stage, make no pause; hence
many persons have stated that Chinese plays are ridiculously
long, the fact being that half-an-hour to an hour
would be about an average length for the plays usually
performed, though much longer specimens, such as
would last from three to five hours, are to be found in
books. Eight or ten plays are often performed at an
ordinary dinner-party, a list of perhaps forty being
handed round for the chief guests to choose from.</p>

<p>The actors undergo a very severe physical training,
usually between the ages of nine and fourteen. They
have to learn all kinds of acrobatic feats, these being
introduced freely into “military” plays. They also have
to practise walking on feet bound up in imitation of
women’s feet, no woman having been allowed on the
stage since the days of the Emperor Ch’ien Lung (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1736-1796), whose mother had been an actress. They
have further to walk about in the open air for an hour
or so every day, the head thrown back and the mouth
wide open in order to strengthen the voice; and finally,
their diet is carefully regulated according to a fixed
system of training. Fifty-six actors make up a full
company, each of whom must know perfectly from 100
to 200 plays, there being no prompter. These do not
include the four- or five-act plays as found in books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
but either acting editions of these, cut down to suit the
requirements of the stage, or short farces specially
written. The actors are ranged under five classes
according to their capabilities, and consequently every
one knows what part he is expected to take in any given
play. Far from being an important personage, as in
ancient Greece, the actor is under a social ban; and for
three generations his descendants may not compete at
the public examinations. Yet he must possess considerable
ability in a certain line; for inasmuch as there
are no properties and no realism, he is wholly dependent
for success upon his own powers of idealisation. There
he is indeed supreme. He will gallop across the stage
on horseback, dismount, and pass his horse on to a
groom. He will wander down a street, and stop at an
open shop-window to flirt with a pretty girl. He will
hide in a forest, or fight from behind a battlemented
wall. He conjures up by histrionic skill the whole
paraphernalia of a scene which in Western countries
is grossly laid out by supers before the curtain goes up.
The general absence of properties is made up to some
extent by the dresses of the actors, which are of the
most gorgeous character, robes for Emperors and
grandees running into figures which would stagger even
a West-end manager.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the actor must be a good contortionist,
and excel in gesture. He must have a good
voice, his part consisting of song and “spoken” in about
equal proportions. To show how utterly the Chinese
disregard realism, it need only be stated that dead men
get up and walk off the stage; sometimes they will
even act the part of bearers and make movements as
though carrying themselves away. Or a servant will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
step across to a leading performer and hand him a cup
of tea to clear his voice.</p>

<p>The merit of the plays performed is not on a level with
the skill of the performer. A Chinese audience does not
go to hear the play, but to see the actor. In 1678, at a
certain market-town, there was a play performed which
represented the execution of the patriot, General Yo Fei
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1141), brought about by the treachery of a rival,
Ch’in Kuei, who forged an order for that purpose. The
actor who played Ch’in Kuei (a term since used contemptuously
for a spittoon) produced a profound sensation;
so much so, that one of the spectators, losing all self-control,
leapt upon the stage and stabbed the unfortunate
man to death.</p>

<p>Most Chinese plays are simple in construction and
weak in plot. They are divided into “military” and
“civil,” which terms have often been wrongly taken in
the senses of tragedy and comedy, tragedy proper being
quite unknown in China. The former usually deal with
historical episodes and heroic or filial acts by historical
characters; and Emperors and Generals and small
armies rush wildly about the stage, sometimes engaged
in single combat, sometimes in turning head over heels.
Battles are fought and rivals or traitors executed before
the very eyes of the audience. The “civil” plays are
concerned with the entanglements of every-day life, and
are usually of a farcical character. As they stand in
classical collections or in acting editions, Chinese plays
are as unobjectionable as Chinese poetry and general
literature. On the stage, however, actors are allowed
great license in gagging, and the direction which their
gag takes is chiefly the reason which keeps respectable
women away from the public play-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>It must therefore always be remembered that there is
the play as it can be read in the library, and again as it
appears in the acting edition to be learnt, and finally as it
is interpreted by the actor. These three are often very
different one from the other.</p>

<p>The following abstract will give a fair idea of the
pieces to be found on the play-bill of any Chinese
theatre:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three Suspicions.</span></p>

<p>At the close of the Ming dynasty, a certain well-known
General was occupied day and night in camp with preparations
for resisting the advance of the rebel army
which ultimately captured Peking. While thus temporarily
absent from home, the tutor engaged for his son
fell ill with severe shivering fits, and the boy, anxious to
do something to relieve the sufferer, went to his mother’s
room and borrowed a thick quilt. Late that night, the
General unexpectedly returned home, and heard from a
slave-girl in attendance of the tutor’s illness and of the
loan of the quilt. Thereupon, he proceeded straight to
the sick-room, to see how the tutor was getting on, but
found him fast asleep. As he was about to retire, he
espied on the ground a pair of women’s slippers, which
had been accidentally brought in with the quilt, and at
once recognised to whom they belonged. Hastily quitting
the still sleeping tutor, and arming himself with a
sharp scimitar, he burst into his wife’s apartment. He
seized the terrified woman by the hair, and told her that
she must die; producing, in reply to her protestations,
the fatal pair of slippers. He yielded, however, to the
entreaties of the assembled slave-girls, and deferred his
vengeance until he had put the following test. He sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a slave-girl to the tutor’s room, himself following close
behind with his naked weapon ready for use, bearing
a message from her mistress to say she was awaiting him
in her own room; in response to which invitation the
voice of the tutor was heard from within, saying, “What!
at this hour of the night? Go away, you bad girl, or I
will tell the master when he comes back!” Still unconvinced,
the jealous General bade his trembling wife
go herself and summon her paramour; resolving that
if the latter but put foot over the threshold, his life
should pay the penalty. But there was no occasion for
murderous violence. The tutor again answered from
within the bolted door, “Madam, I may not be a saint,
but I would at least seek to emulate the virtuous Chao
Wên-hua (the Joseph of China). Go, and leave me in
peace.” The General now changes his tone; and the
injured wife, she too changes hers. She attempts to
commit suicide, and is only dissuaded by an abject
apology on the part of her husband; in the middle of
which, as the latter is on his knees, a slave-girl creates
roars of laughter by bringing her master, in mistake for
wine, a brimming goblet of vinegar, the Chinese emblem
of connubial jealousy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is a translation of the acting edition of a
short play, as commonly performed, illustrating, but not
to exaggeration, the slender and insufficient literary art
which satisfies the Chinese public, the verses of the
original being quite as much doggerel as those of the
English version:&mdash;</p>

<p>Even the longer and more elaborate plays are proportionately
wanting in all that makes the drama piquant to
a European, and are very seldom, if ever, produced as
they stand in print. Many collections of these have been
published, not to mention the acting editions of each
play, which can be bought at any bookstall for something
like three a penny. One of the best of such
collections is the <cite>Yüan ch’ü hsüan tsa chi</cite>, or Miscellaneous
Selection of Mongol Plays, bound up in eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
thick volumes. It contains one hundred plays in all,
with an illustration to each, according to the edition of
1615. A large proportion of these cannot be assigned
to any author, and are therefore marked “anonymous.”
Even when the authors’ names are given, they
represent men altogether unknown in what the Chinese
call literature, from which the drama is rigorously
excluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHI CHÜN-HSIANG</div>

<p>The following is a brief outline of a very well known
play in five acts by <span class="smcap">Chi Chün-hsiang</span>, entitled “The
Orphan of the Chao family,” and founded closely upon
fact. It is the nearest approach which the Chinese have
made to genuine tragedy:&mdash;</p>

<p>A wicked Minister of the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> plotted the
destruction of a rival named Chao Tun, and of all his
family. He tells in the prologue how he had vainly
trained a fierce dog to kill his rival, by keeping it for days
without food and then setting it at a dummy, dressed
to represent his intended victim, and stuffed with the
heart and lights of a sheep. Ultimately, however, he
had managed to get rid of all the male members of the
family, to the number of three hundred, when he hears&mdash;and
at this point the play proper begins&mdash;that the
wife of the last representative has given birth to a son.
He promptly sends to find the child, which had meanwhile
been carried away to a place of safety. Then a
faithful servant of the family hid himself on the hills
with another child, while an accomplice informed the
Minister where the supposed orphan of the house of
Chao was lying hidden. The child was accordingly
slain, and by the hand of the Minister himself; the
servant committed suicide. But the real heir escaped,
and when he grew up he avenged the wrongs of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
family by killing the cruel Minister and utterly exterminating
his race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From beginning to end of this and similar plays there
is apparently no attempt whatever at passion or pathos
in the language&mdash;at any rate, not in the sense in which
those terms are understood by us. Nor are there even
rhetorical flowers to disguise the expression of commonplace
thought. The Chinese actor can do a great deal
with such a text; the translator, nothing. There is much,
too, of a primitive character in the setting of the play.
Explanatory prologues are common, and actors usually
begin by announcing their own names and further
clearing the way for the benefit of the audience. The
following story will give a faint idea of the license
conceded to the play-actor.</p>

<p>My attention was attracted on one occasion at Amoy by
an unusually large crowd of Chinamen engaged in watching
the progress of an open-air theatrical performance.
Roars of laughter resounded on all sides, and on looking
to see what was the moving cause of this extraordinary
explosion of merriment, I beheld to my astonishment a
couple of rather seedy-looking foreigners occupying the
stage, and apparently acting with such spirit as to bring
the house down at every other word. A moment more
and it was clear that these men of the West were not
foreigners at all, but Chinamen dressed up for the
purposes of the piece. The get-up, nevertheless, was remarkably
good, if somewhat exaggerated, though doubtless
the intention was to caricature or burlesque rather
than to reproduce an exact imitation. There was the billy-cock
hat, and below it a florid face well supplied with red
moustaches and whiskers, the short cut-away coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
light trousers, a blue neck-tie, and last, but not least, the
ever-characteristic walking-stick. Half the fun, in fact,
was got out of this last accessory; for with it each one
of the two was continually threatening the other, and
both united in violent gesticulations directed either
against their brother-actors or sometimes against the
audience at their feet.</p>

<p>Before going any further it may be as well to give a
short outline of the play itself, which happens to be not
uninteresting and is widely known from one end of
China to the other. It is called “Slaying a Son at the
Yamên Gate,” and the plot, or rather story, runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain general of the Sung dynasty named Yang,
being in charge of one of the frontier passes, sent his
son to obtain a certain wooden staff from an outlying
barbarian tribe. In this expedition the son not only
failed signally, but was further taken prisoner by a
barbarian lady, who insisted upon his immediately
leading her to the altar. Shortly after these nuptials he
returns to his father’s camp, and the latter, in a violent
fit of anger, orders him to be taken outside the Yamên
gate and be there executed forthwith. As the soldiers
are leading him away, the young man’s mother comes
and throws herself at the general’s feet, and implores
him to spare her son. This request the stern father
steadily refuses to grant, even though his wife’s prayers
are backed up by those of his own mother, of a prince
of the Imperial blood, and finally by the entreaties of
the Emperor himself. At this juncture in rushes the
barbarian wife of the general’s condemned son, and as
on a previous occasion the general himself had been
taken prisoner by this very lady, and only ransomed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
payment of a heavy sum of money, he is so alarmed
that he sits motionless and unable to utter a word while
with a dagger she severs the cords that bind her husband,
sets him free before the assembled party, and
dares any one to lay a hand on him at his peril. The
Emperor now loses his temper, and is enraged to think
that General Yang should have been awed into granting
to a barbarian woman a life that he had just before
refused to the entreaties of the Son of Heaven. His
Majesty, therefore, at once deprives the father of his
command and bestows it upon the son, and the
play is brought to a conclusion with the departure
of young General Yang and his barbarian wife to
subdue the wild tribes that are then harassing the
frontier of China. The two foreigners are the pages
or attendants of the barbarian wife, and accompany
her in that capacity when she follows her husband to
his father’s camp.</p>

<p>The trick of dressing these pages up to caricature the
foreigner of the nineteenth century, on the occasion
when I saw the piece, was a mere piece of stage gag,
but one which amused the people immensely, and
elicited rounds of applause. But when the barbarian
wife had succeeded in rescuing her husband from the
jaws of death, there was considerable dissatisfaction in
the minds of several of the personages on the stage.
The Emperor was angry at the slight that had been
passed upon his Imperial dignity, the wife and mother of
the general, not to mention the prince of the blood, felt
themselves similarly slighted, though in a lesser degree,
and the enraged father was still more excited at having
had his commands set aside, and seeing himself bearded
in his own Yamên by a mere barbarian woman. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
consequently felt by all parties that something in the
way of slaughter was wanting to relieve their own
feelings, and to satisfy the unities of the drama and the
cravings of the audience for a sensational finale; and
this desirable end was attained by an order from the
Emperor that at any rate the two foreign attendants
might be sacrificed for the benefit of all concerned. The
two wretched foreigners were accordingly made to kneel
on the stage, and their heads were promptly lopped off
by the executioner amid the deafening plaudits of the
surrounding spectators.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1885 a play was performed in a Shanghai theatre
which had for its special attraction a rude imitation of a
paddle-steamer crowded with foreign men and women.
It was wheeled across the back of the stage, and the
foreigners and their women, who were supposed to have
come with designs upon the Middle Kingdom, were all
taken prisoners and executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANG SHIH-FU</div>

<p>Of all plays of the Mongol dynasty, the one which will
best repay reading is undoubtedly the <cite>Hsi Hsiang Chi</cite>, or
Story of the Western Pavilion, in sixteen scenes. It is
by <span class="smcap">Wang Shih-fu</span>, of whom nothing seems to be known
except that he flourished in the thirteenth century, and
wrote thirteen plays, all of which are included in the
collection mentioned above. “The dialogue of this
play,” says a Chinese critic, “deals largely with wind,
flowers, snow, and moonlight,” which is simply a euphemistic
way of stating that the story is one of passion and
intrigue. It is popular with the educated classes, by
whom it is regarded more as a novel than as a play.</p>

<p>A lady and her daughter are staying at a temple,

let by the priests to ordinary travellers or to visitors who
may wish to perform devotional exercises. A young
and handsome student, who also happens to be living
at the temple, is lucky enough to succeed in saving
the two ladies from the clutches of brigands, for which
service he has previously been promised the hand of
the daughter in marriage. The mother, however, soon
repents of her engagement, and the scholar is left
disconsolate. At this juncture the lady’s-maid of the
daughter manages by a series of skilful manœuvres to
bring the story to a happy issue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANG KUO-PIN</div>

<p>Just as there have always been poetesses in China, so
women are to be found in the ranks of Chinese playwrights.
A four-act drama, entitled “Joining the Shirt,”
was written by one <span class="smcap">Chang Kuo-pin</span>, an educated courtesan
of the day, the chief interest of which play lies
perhaps in the sex of the writer.</p>

<p>A father and mother, with son and daughter-in-law,
are living happily together, when a poverty-stricken
young stranger is first of all assisted by them, and then,
without further inquiry, is actually adopted into the
family. Soon afterwards the new son persuades the
elder brother and his wife secretly to leave home, taking
all the property they can lay their hands on, and to
journey to a distant part of the country, where there is
a potent god from whom the wife is to pray for and
obtain a son after what has been already an eighteen
months’ gestation. On the way, the new brother pushes
the husband overboard into the Yang-tsze and disappears
with the wife, who shortly gives birth to a boy.
Eighteen years pass. The old couple have sunk into
poverty, and set out, begging their way, to seek for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
lost son. Chance&mdash;playwright’s chance&mdash;throws them
into the company of their grandson, who has graduated
as Senior Classic, and has also, prompted by his mother,
been on the look-out for them. Recognition is effected
by means of the two halves of a shirt, one of which had
always been kept by the old man and the other by the
missing son, and after his death by his wife. At this
juncture the missing son reappears. He had been
rescued from drowning by a boatman, and had become
a Buddhist priest. He now reverts to lay life, and the
play is brought to an end by the execution of the villain.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that all the best troupes of actors
not only come from Peking, but perform in their own
dialect, which is practically unintelligible to the masses
in many parts of China. These actors are, of course,
very well paid, in order to make it worth their while to
travel so far from home and take the risks to life and
property.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

THE NOVEL</h3>


<p>Turning now to the second literary achievement of the
Mongols, the introduction of the Novel, we find ourselves
face to face with the same mystery as that which shrouds
the birth of the Drama. The origin of the Chinese
novel is unknown. It probably came from Central Asia,
the paradise of story-tellers, in the wake of the Mongol
conquest. Three centuries had then to elapse before the
highest point of development was reached. Fables, anecdotes,
and even short stories had already been familiar
to the Chinese for many centuries, but between these and
the novel proper there is a wide gulf which so far had
not been satisfactorily bridged. Some, indeed, have
maintained that the novel was developed from the play,
pointing in corroboration of their theory to the <cite>Hsi
Hsiang Chi</cite>, or Story of the Western Pavilion, described
in the preceding chapter. This, however, simply means
that the <cite>Hsi Hsiang Chi</cite> is more suited for private reading
than for public representation, as is the case with
many Western plays.</p>

<p>The Chinese range their novels under four heads, as
dealing (1) with usurpation and plotting, (2) with love
and intrigue, (3) with superstition, and (4) with brigandage
or lawless characters generally. Examples of each
class will be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LO KUAN-CHUNG</div>

<p>The <cite>San kuo chih yen i</cite>, attributed to one <span class="smcap">Lo Kuan-chung</span>,
is an historical novel based upon the wars of the
Three Kingdoms which fought for supremacy at the
beginning of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> It consists mainly of
stirring scenes of warfare, of cunning plans by skilful
generals, and of doughty deeds by blood-stained
warriors. Armies and fleets of countless myriads are
from time to time annihilated by one side or another,&mdash;all
this in an easy and fascinating style, which makes
the book an endless joy to old and young alike. If a
vote were taken among the people of China as to the
greatest among their countless novels, the Story of the
Three Kingdoms would indubitably come out first.</p>

<p>This is how the great commander Chu-ko Liang is said
to have replenished his failing stock of arrows. He sent
a force of some twenty or more ships to feign an attack
on the fleet of his powerful rival, Ts’ao Ts’ao. The
decks of the ships were apparently covered with large
numbers of fighting men, but these were in reality
nothing more than straw figures dressed up in soldiers’
clothes. On each ship there were only a few sailors and
some real soldiers with gongs and other noisy instruments.
Reaching their destination, as had been carefully
calculated beforehand, in the middle of a dense
fog, the soldiers at once began to beat on their gongs as
if about to go into action; whereupon Ts’ao Ts’ao, who
could just make out the outlines of vessels densely
packed with fighting men bearing down upon him, gave
orders to his archers to begin shooting. The latter did
so, and kept on for an hour and more, until Chu-ko
Liang was satisfied with what he had got, and passed the
order to retreat.</p>

<p>Elsewhere we read of an archery competition which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
recalls the Homeric games. A target is set up, and the
prize, a robe, is hung upon a twig just above. From a
distance of one hundred paces the heroes begin to shoot.
Of course each competitor hits the bull’s-eye, one,
Parthian-like, with his back to the target, another shooting
over his own head; and equally of course the
favoured hero shoots at the twig, severs it, and carries
off the robe.</p>

<p>The following extract will perhaps be interesting, dealing
as it does with the use of anæsthetics long before
they were dreamt of in this country. Ts’ao Ts’ao had
been struck on the head with a sword by the spirit of
a pear-tree which he had attempted to cut down. He
suffered such agony that one of his staff recommended
a certain doctor who was then very much in vogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Dr. Hua,’ explained the officer, ‘is a mighty skilful
physician, and such a one as is not often to be found.
His administration of drugs, and his use of acupuncture
and counter-irritants are always followed by the speedy
recovery of the patient. If the sick man is suffering
from some internal complaint and medicines produce no
satisfactory result, then Dr. Hua will administer a dose
of hashish, under the influence of which the patient
becomes as it were intoxicated with wine. He now
takes a sharp knife and opens the abdomen, proceeding
to wash the patient’s viscera with medicinal liquids, but
without causing him the slightest pain. The washing
finished, he sews up the wound with medicated thread
and puts over it a plaster, and by the end of a month or
twenty days the place has healed up. Such is his extraordinary
skill. One day, for instance, as he was walking
along a road, he heard some one groaning deeply, and at
once declared that the cause was indigestion. On inquiry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
this turned out to be the case; and accordingly, Dr. Hua
ordered the sufferer to drink three pints of a decoction
of garlic and leeks, which he did, and vomited forth a
snake between two and three feet in length, after which
he could digest food as before. On another occasion, the
Governor of Kuang-ling was very much depressed in his
mind, besides being troubled with a flushing of the face
and total loss of appetite. He consulted Dr. Hua, and
the effect of some medicine administered by him was to
cause the invalid to throw up a quantity of red-headed
wriggling tadpoles, which the doctor told him had been
generated in his system by too great indulgence in fish,
and which, although temporarily expelled, would reappear
after an interval of three years, when nothing
could save him. And sure enough, he died three years
afterwards. In a further instance, a man had a tumour
growing between his eyebrows, the itching of which was
insupportable. When Dr. Hua saw it, he said, ‘There is
a bird inside,’ at which everybody laughed. However,
he took a knife and opened the tumour, and out flew a
canary, the patient beginning to recover from that hour.
Again, another man had had his toes bitten by a dog,
the consequence being that two lumps of flesh grew up
from the wound, one of which was very painful while
the other itched unbearably. ‘There are ten needles,’
said Dr. Hua, ‘in the sore lump, and two black and
white <i>wei-ch’i</i> pips in the other.’ No one believed this
until Dr. Hua opened them with a knife and showed that
it was so. Truly he is of the same strain as Pien Ch’iao
and Ts’ang Kung of old; and as he is now living not
very far from this, I wonder your Highness does not
summon him.’</p>

<p>“At this, Ts’ao Ts’ao sent away messengers who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to travel day and night until they had brought Dr. Hua
before him; and when he arrived, Ts’ao Ts’ao held out
his pulse and desired him to diagnose his case.</p>

<p>“‘The pain in your Highness’s head’ said Dr. Hua,
‘arises from wind, and the seat of the disease is the
brain, where the wind is collected, unable to get out.
Drugs are of no avail in your present condition, for
which there is but one remedy. You must first swallow
a dose of hashish, and then with a sharp axe I will split
open the back of your head and let the wind out. Thus
the disease will be exterminated.’</p>

<p>“Ts’ao Ts’ao here flew into a great rage, and declared
that it was a plot aimed at his life; to which Dr. Hua
replied, ‘Has not your Highness heard of Kuan Yü’s
wound in the right shoulder? I scraped the bone and
removed the poison for him without a single sign of fear
on his part. Your Highness’s disease is but a trifling
affair; why, then, so much suspicion?’</p>

<p>“‘You may scrape a sore shoulder-bone,’ said Ts’ao
Ts’ao, ‘without much risk; but to split open my skull is
quite another matter. It strikes me now that you are
here simply to avenge your friend Kuan Yü upon this
opportunity.’ He thereupon gave orders that the doctor
should be seized and cast into prison.”</p>

<p>There the unfortunate doctor soon afterwards died,
and before very long Ts’ao Ts’ao himself succumbed.</p>

<p>The <cite>Shui Hu Chuan</cite> is said to have been written by
<span class="smcap">Shin Nai-an</span> of the thirteenth century; but this name
does not appear in any biographical collection, and nothing
seems to be known either of the man or of his
authorship. The story is based upon the doings of an
historical band of brigands, who had actually terrorised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a couple of provinces, until they were finally put down,
early in the twelfth century. Some of it is very laughable,
and all of it valuable for the insight given into
Chinese manners and customs. There is a ludicrous
episode of a huge swashbuckler who took refuge in a
Buddhist temple and became a priest. After a while he
reverted to less ascetic habits of life, and returned one
day to the temple, in Chinese phraseology, as drunk as
a clod, making a great riot and causing much scandal.
He did this on a second occasion; and when shut out
by the gatekeeper, he tried to burst in, and in his drunken
fury knocked to pieces a huge idol at the entrance for
not stepping down to his assistance. Then, when he
succeeded by a threat of fire in getting the monks to
open the gate, “through which no wine or meat may
pass,” he fell down in the courtyard, and out of his robe
tumbled a half-eaten dog’s leg, which he had carried
away with him from the restaurant where he had drunk
himself tipsy. This he amused himself by tearing to
pieces and forcing into the mouth of one of his fellow-priests.</p>

<p>The graphic and picturesque style in which this book

for it a position rather beyond its real merits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HSI YU CHI</div>

<p>The <cite>Hsi Yu Chi</cite>, or Record of Travels in the West,
is a favourite novel written in a popular and easy style.
It is based upon the journey of Hsüan Tsang to India
in search of books, images, and relics to illustrate
the Buddhist religion; but beyond the fact that the
chief personage is called by Hsüan Tsang’s posthumous
title, and that he travels in search of Buddhist books,
the journey and the novel have positively nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
common. The latter is a good sample of the fiction in
which the Chinese people delight, and may be allowed
to detain us awhile.</p>

<p>A stone monkey is born on a mysterious mountain
from a stone egg, and is soon elected to be king of the
monkeys. He then determines to travel in search of
wisdom, and accordingly sets forth. His first step is to
gain a knowledge of the black art from a magician, after
which he becomes Master of the Horse to God, that is,
to the supreme deity in the Taoist Pantheon. Throwing
up his post in disgust, he carries on a series of disturbances
in the world generally, until at length God is
obliged to interfere, and sends various heavenly generals
to coerce him. These he easily puts to flight, only returning
to his allegiance on being appointed the Great
Holy One of All the Heavens. He is soon at his old
tricks again, stealing the peaches of immortality from
a legendary being known as the Royal Mother in the
West, and also some elixir of life, both of which he
consumes.</p>

<p>All the minor deities now complain to God of his
many misdeeds, and heavenly armies are despatched
against him, but in vain. Even God’s nephew cannot
prevail against him until Lao Tzŭ throws a magic ring
at him and knocks him down. He is then carried captive
to heaven, but as he is immortal, no harm can be inflicted
on him.</p>

<p>At this juncture God places the matter in the hands
of Buddha, who is presently informed by the monkey
that God must be deposed and that he, the monkey,
must for the future reign in his stead. The text now
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When Buddha heard these words, he smiled scorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>fully
and said, ‘What! a devil-monkey like you to seize
the throne of God, who from his earliest years has been
trained to rule, and has lived 1750 æons, each of 129,600
years’ duration! Think what ages of apprenticeship he
had to serve before he could reach this state of perfect
wisdom. You are only a brute beast; what mean these
boastful words? Be off, and utter no more such, lest
evil befall, and your very existence be imperilled.’</p>

<p>“‘Although he is older than I am,’ cried the monkey,
‘that is no reason why he should always have the post.
Tell him to get out and give up his place to me, or I will
know the reason why.’</p>

<p>“‘What abilities have you,’ asked Buddha, ‘that
you should claim the divine palace?’</p>

<p>“‘Plenty,’ replied the monkey. ‘I can change myself
into seventy-two shapes; I am immortal; and I can turn
a somersault to a distance of 18,000 <i>li</i> ( = 6000 miles).
Am I not fit to occupy the throne of heaven?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ answered Buddha, ‘I will make a wager with
you. If you can jump out of my hand, I will request
God to depart to the West and leave heaven to you;
but if you fail, you will go down again to earth and be a
devil for another few æons to come.’</p>

<p>“The monkey readily agreed to this, pointing out that
he could easily jump 18,000 <i>li</i>, and that Buddha’s hand
was not even a foot long. So after making Buddha promise
to carry out the agreement, he grasped his sceptre
and diminished in size until he could stand in the hand,
which was stretched out for him like a lotus-leaf. ‘I’m
off!’ he cried, and in a moment he was gone. But
Buddha’s enlightened gaze was ever upon him, though
he turned with the speed of a whirligig.</p>

<p>“In a brief space the monkey had reached a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
where there were five red pillars, and there he decided
to stop. Reflecting, however, that he had better leave
some trace as a proof of his visit, he plucked out a hair,
and changing it into a pencil, wrote with it on the middle
pillar in large characters, <i>The Great Holy One of All the
Heavens reached this point</i>. The next moment he was
back again in Buddha’s hand, describing his jump, and
claiming his reward.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said Buddha, ‘I knew you couldn’t do it.’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ said the monkey, ‘I have been to the very
confines of the universe, and have left a mark there
which I challenge you to inspect.’</p>

<p>“‘There is no need to go so far,’ replied Buddha.
‘Just bend your head and look here.’</p>

<p>“The monkey bent down his head, and there, on
Buddha’s middle finger, he read the following inscription:
<i>The Great Holy One of All the Heavens reached this
point</i>.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, the monkey is converted to the true faith,
and undertakes to escort Hsüan Tsang on his journey
to the West. In his turn he helps to convert a pig-bogey,
whom he first vanquishes by changing himself into a
pill, which the pig-bogey unwittingly swallows, thereby
giving its adversary a chance of attacking it from inside.
These two are joined by a colourless individual, said to
represent the passive side of man’s nature, as the monkey
and pig represent the active and animal sides respectively.
The three of them conduct Hsüan Tsang through
manifold dangers and hairbreadth escapes safe, until at
length they receive final directions from an Immortal
as to the position of the palace of Buddha, from which
they hope to obtain the coveted books. The scene
which follows almost recalls <cite>The Pilgrims Progress</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hsüan Tsang accordingly bade him farewell and
proceeded on his way. But he had not gone more than
a mile or two before he came to a stream of rushing
water about a league in breadth, with not a trace of any
living being in sight. At this he was somewhat startled,
and turning to Wu-k’ung (the name of the monkey)
said, ‘Our guide must surely have misdirected us. Look
at that broad and boiling river; how shall we ever get
across without a boat?’ ‘There is a bridge over there,’
cried Wu-k’ung, ‘which you must cross over in order
to complete your salvation.’ At this Hsüan Tsang
and the others advanced in the direction indicated, and
saw by the side of the bridge a notice-board on which
was written, ‘The Heavenly Ford.’ Now the bridge
itself consisted of a simple plank; on which Hsüan
Tsang remarked, ‘I am not going to trust myself to that
frail and slippery plank to cross that wide and rapid
stream. Let us try somewhere else.’ ‘But this is the
true path,’ said Wu-k’ung; ‘just wait a moment and see
me go across.’ Thereupon he jumped on to the bridge,
and ran along the shaky vibrating plank until he reached
the other side, where he stood shouting out to the rest
to come on. But Hsüan Tsang waved his hand in the
negative, while his companions stood by biting their
fingers and crying out, ‘We can’t! we can’t! we can’t!’
So Wu-k’ung ran back, and seizing Pa-chieh (the pig)
by the arm, began dragging him to the bridge, all the
time calling him a fool for his pains. Pa-chieh then
threw himself on the ground, roaring out, ‘It’s too
slippery&mdash;it’s too slippery. I can’t do it. Spare me!
spare me!’ ‘You must cross by this bridge,’ replied
Wu-k’ung, ‘if you want to become a Buddha;’ at
which Pa-chieh said, ‘Then I can’t be a Buddha, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
I have done with it: I shall never get across that
bridge.’</p>

<p>“While these two were in the middle of their dispute,
lo and behold a boat appeared in sight, with a man
punting it along, and calling out, ‘The ferry! the ferry!’
At this Hsüan Tsang was overjoyed, and shouted to his
disciples that they would now be able to get across.
By his fiery pupil and golden iris, Wu-k’ung knew that
the ferryman was no other than Namo Pao-chang-kuang-wang
Buddha; but he kept his knowledge to
himself, and hailed the boat to take them on board. In
a moment it was alongside the bank, when, to his unutterable
horror, Hsüan Tsang discovered that the boat
had no bottom, and at once asked the ferryman how he
proposed to take them across. ‘My boat,’ replied the
ferryman, ‘has been famed since the resolution of chaos
into order, and under my charge has known no change.
Steady though storms may rage and seas may roll, there
is no fear so long as the passenger is light. Free from
the dust of mortality, the passage is easy enough. Ten
thousand kalpas of human beings pass over in peace.
A bottomless ship can hardly cross the great ocean;
yet for ages past I have ferried over countless hosts of
passengers.’</p>

<p>“When he heard these words Wu-k’ung cried out,
‘Master, make haste on board. This boat, although
bottomless, is safe enough, and no wind or sea could
overset it.’ And while Hsüan Tsang was still hesitating,
Wu-k’ung pushed him forwards on to the bridge; but
the former could not keep his feet, and fell head over
heels into the water, from which he was immediately
rescued by the ferryman, who dragged him on board
the boat. The rest also managed, with the aid of Wu-k’ung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
to scramble on board; and then, as the ferryman
shoved off, lo! they beheld a dead body floating away
down the stream. Hsüan Tsang was greatly alarmed at
this; but Wu-k’ung laughed and said, ‘Fear not, Master;
that dead body is your old self!’ And all the others
joined in the chorus of ‘It is you, sir, it is you;’ and
even the ferryman said, ‘Yes, it is you; accept my best
congratulations.’</p>

<p>“A few moments more and the stream was crossed,
when they all jumped on shore; but before they could
look round the boat and ferryman had disappeared.”</p>

<p>The story ends with a list of the Buddhist <i>sûtras</i> and
liturgies which the travellers were allowed to carry back
with them to their own country.</p>

MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE&mdash;MATERIA

AGRICULTURE</h3>


<div class="sidenote">SUNG LIEN</div>

<p>The first Emperor of the Ming dynasty, popularly known
as the Beggar King, in allusion to the poverty of his
early days, so soon as he had extinguished the last hopes
of the Mongols and had consolidated his power, turned
his attention to literature and education. He organised
the great system of competitive examinations which prevails
at the present day. He also published a Penal
Code, abolishing such punishments as mutilation, and
drew up a kind of Domesday Book, under which taxation
was regulated. In 1369 he appointed <span class="smcap">Sung Lien</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1310-1381), in conjunction with other scholars, to produce
the History of the Mongol Dynasty. Sung Lien had
previously been tutor to the heir apparent. He had
declined office, and was leading the life of a simple
student. He rose to be President of the Han-lin College,
and for many years enjoyed his master’s confidence. A
grandson, however, became mixed up in a conspiracy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
only the Empress’s entreaties saved the old man’s life.
His sentence was commuted to banishment, and he died
on the journey. Apart from the history above mentioned,
and a pronouncing dictionary on which he was
employed, his literary remains fill only three volumes.
The following piece is a satire on the neglect of men of
ability, which, according to him, was a marked feature
of the administration of the Mongols:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Têng Pi, whose cognomen was Po-i, was a man of
Ch’in. He was seven feet high. Both his eyes had
crimson corners, and they blinked like lightning flashes.
In feats of strength he was cock of the walk; and once
when his neighbour’s bulls were locked in fight, with a
blow of his fist he broke the back of one of them and
sent it rolling on the ground. The stone drums of the
town, which ten men could not lift, he could carry about
in his two hands. He was, however, very fond of liquor,
and given to quarrelling in his cups; so that when people
saw him in this mood, they would keep out of his way,
saying that it was safer to be at a distance from such a
wild fellow.</p>

<p>“One day he was drinking by himself in a tea-house
when two literati happened to pass by. Têng Pi tried
to make them join him; but they, having rather a low
opinion of the giant, would not accept his invitation.
‘Gentlemen,’ cried he in a rage, ‘if you do not see fit to
do as I ask, I will make an end of the pair of you, and
then seek safety in flight. I could not brook this treatment
at your hands.’</p>

<p>“So the two had no alternative but to walk in. Têng Pi
took the place of honour himself, and put his guests on
each side of him. He called for more liquor, and began
to sing and make a noise. And at last, when he was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
tipsy, he threw off his clothes and began to attitudinise.
He drew a knife, and flung it down with a bang on the
table; at which the two literati, who were aware of his
weakness, rose to take leave.</p>

<p>“‘Stop!’ shouted Têng Pi, detaining them. ‘I too
know something about your books. What do you mean
by treating me as the spittle of your mouth? If you don’t
hurry up and drink, I fear my temper will get the better
of me. Meanwhile, you shall ask me anything you like
in the whole range of classical literature, and if I can’t
answer, I will imbrue this blade in my blood.’</p>

<p>“To this the two literati agreed, and forthwith gave him
a number of the most difficult allusions they could think
of, taken from the Classics; but Têng Pi was equal to
the occasion, and repeated the full quotation in each case
without missing a word. Then they tried him on history,
covering a period of three thousand years; but here again
his answers were distinguished by accuracy and precision.</p>

<p>“‘Ha! ha!’ laughed Têng Pi, ‘do you give in now?’
At which his guests looked blankly at each other, and
hadn’t a word to say. So Têng Pi shouted for wine, and
loosed his hair, and jumped about, crying, ‘I have
floored you, gentlemen, to-day! Of old, learning made a
man of you; but to-day, all you have to do is to don a
scholar’s dress and look consumptive. You care only to
excel with pen and ink, and despise the real heroes of the
age. Shall this be so indeed?’</p>

<p>“Now these two literati were men of some reputation,
and on hearing Têng Pi’s words they were greatly
shamed, and left the tea-house, hardly knowing how to
put one foot before the other. On arriving home they
made further inquiries, but no one had ever seen Têng
Pi at any time with a book in his hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FANG HSIAO-JU</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fang Hsiao-ju</span> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1357-1402) is another scholar, co-worker
with Sung Lien, who adorned this same period.
As a child he was precocious, and by his skill in
composition earned for himself the nickname of Little
Han Yü. He became tutor to one of the Imperial
princes, and was loaded with honours by the second
Emperor, who through the death of his father succeeded
in 1398 to his grandfather. Then came the
rebellion of the fourth son of the first Emperor; and
when Nanking opened its gates to the conqueror, the
defeated nephew vanished. It is supposed that he fled to
Yünnan, in the garb of a monk, left to him, so the story
runs, with full directions by his grandfather. After
nearly forty years’ wandering, he is said to have gone to
Peking, and lived in seclusion in the palace until his
death. He was recognised by a eunuch from a mole on
his left foot, but the eunuch was afraid to reveal his
identity. Fang Hsiao-ju absolutely refused to place his
services at the disposal of the new Emperor, who ruled
under the year-title of Yung Lo. For this refusal he was
cut to pieces in the market-place, his family being as far
as possible exterminated and his philosophical writings
burned. A small collection of his miscellanies was preserved
by a faithful disciple, and afterwards republished.
The following is an extract from an essay on taking too
much thought for the morrow:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Statesmen who forecast the destinies of an empire
ofttimes concentrate their genius upon the difficult and
neglect the easy. They provide against likely evils, and
disregard combinations which yield no ground for suspicion.
Yet calamity often issues from neglected quarters,
and sedition springs out of circumstances which have
been set aside as trivial. Must this be regarded as due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to an absence of care?&mdash;No. It results because the
things that man can provide against are human, while
those that elude his vigilance and overpower his strength
are divine.”</p>

<p>After giving several striking examples from history,
the writer continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>“All the instances above cited include gifted men
whose wisdom and genius overshadowed their generation.
They took counsel and provided against disruption
of the empire with the utmost possible care. Yet misfortune
fell upon every one of them, always issuing from
some source where its existence was least suspected.
This, because human wisdom reaches only to human
affairs and cannot touch the divine. Thus, too, will
sickness carry off the children even of the best doctors,
and devils play their pranks in the family of an exorcist.
How is it that these professors, who succeed in grappling
with the cases of others, yet fail in treating their own?
It is because in those they confine themselves to the
human; in these they would meddle with the divine.</p>

<p>“The men of old knew that it was impossible to
provide infallibly against the convulsions of ages to
come. There was no plan, no device, by which they
could hope to prevail, and they refrained accordingly
from vain scheming. They simply strove by the force
of Truth and Virtue to win for themselves the approbation
of God; that He, in reward for their virtuous
conduct, might watch over them, as a fond mother
watches over her babes, for ever. Thus, although fools
were not wanting to their posterity&mdash;fools able to drag
an empire to the dust&mdash;still, the evil day was deferred.
This was indeed foresight of a far-reaching kind.</p>

<p>“But he who, regardless of the favour of Heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
may hope by the light of his own petty understanding to
establish that which shall endure through all time&mdash;he
shall be confounded indeed.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The third Emperor of this dynasty, whose nephew,
the reigning Emperor, disappeared so mysteriously,
mounted the throne in 1403. A worthy son of his father
as regarded his military and political abilities, he was a
still more enthusiastic patron of literature. He caused
to be compiled what is probably the most gigantic
encyclopædia ever known, the <cite>Yung Lo Ta Tien</cite>, to
produce which 2169 scholars laboured for about three
years under the guidance of five chief directors and
twenty sub-directors. Judging from the account published
in 1795, it must have run to over 500,000 pages.
It was never printed because of the cost of the block-cutting;
but under a subsequent reign two extra copies
were taken, and one of these, imperfect to the extent of
about 20,000 pages, is still in the Han-lin College at
Peking.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The others perished by fire at the fall of the
Ming dynasty. Not only did this encyclopædia embrace
and illustrate the whole range of Chinese literature, but
it included many complete works which would otherwise
have been lost. Of these, no fewer than 66 on the Confucian
Canon, 41 on history, 103 on philosophy, and 175
on poetry were copied out and inserted in the Imperial
Library.</p>

<p>Many names of illustrious scholars must here, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
indeed throughout this volume, be passed over in
silence. Such writers are more than compensated
by the honour they receive from their own countrymen,
who place classical scholarship at the very summit
of human ambitions, and rank the playwright and
the novelist as mere parasites of literature. Between
these two extremes there is always to be found a great
deal of general writing, which, while it satisfies the
fastidious claim of the Chinese critic for form in preference
even to matter, is also of sufficient interest for
the European reader.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">YANG CHI-SHÊNG</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yang Chi-shêng</span> (1515-1556) was a statesman and a
patriot, who had been a cowherd in his youth. He first
got himself into trouble by opposing the establishment
of a horse-market on the frontier, between China and
Tartary, as menacing the safety of his country. Restored
to favour after temporary degradation, he impeached a
colleague, now known as the worst of the Six Traitorous
Ministers of the Ming dynasty. His adversary was too
strong for him. Yang was sent to prison, and three
years later his head fell. His name has no place in
literature; nor would it be mentioned here except as an
introduction to an impassioned memorial which his wife
addressed to the Emperor on her husband’s behalf:&mdash;</p>

<p>“May it please your Majesty,&mdash;My husband was chief
Minister in the Cavalry Department of the Board of War.
Because he advised your Majesty against the establishment
of a tradal mart, hoping to prevent Ch’ou Luan
from carrying out his design, he was condemned only
to a mild punishment; and then, when the latter suffered
defeat, he was restored to favour and to his former
honours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thereafter, my husband was for ever seeking to make
some return for the Imperial clemency. He would
deprive himself of sleep. He would abstain from food.
All this I saw with my own eyes. By and by, however,
he gave ear to some idle rumour of the market-place, and
the old habit came strong upon him. He lost his mental
balance. He uttered wild statements, and again incurred
the displeasure of the Throne. Yet he was not slain
forthwith. His punishment was referred to the Board.
He was beaten; he was thrown into prison. Several
times he nearly died. His flesh was hollowed out beneath
the scourge; the sinews of his legs were severed.
Blood flowed from him in bowlfuls, splashing him from
head to foot. Confined day and night in a cage, he
endured the utmost misery.</p>

<p>“Then our crops failed, and daily food was wanting in
our poverty-stricken home. I strove to earn money by
spinning, and worked hard for the space of three years,
during which period the Board twice addressed the
Throne, receiving on each occasion an Imperial rescript
that my husband was to await his fate in gaol. But
now I hear your Majesty has determined that my
husband shall die, in accordance with the statutes of the
Empire. Die as he may, his eyes will close in peace
with your Majesty, while his soul seeks the realms below.</p>

<p>“Yet I know that your Majesty has a humane and
kindly heart; and when the creeping things of the earth,&mdash;nay,
the very trees and shrubs,&mdash;share in the national
tranquillity, it is hard to think that your Majesty would
grudge a pitying glance upon our fallen estate. And
should we be fortunate enough to attract the Imperial
favour to our lowly affairs, that would be joy indeed.
But if my husband’s crime is of too deep a dye, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
humbly beg that my head may pay the penalty, and that
I be permitted to die for him. Then, from the far-off
land of spirits, myself brandishing spear and shield, I will
lead forth an army of fierce hobgoblins to do battle in
your Majesty’s behalf, and thus make some return for
this act of Imperial grace.”</p>

<p>“The force of language,” says the commentator, “can
no farther go.” Yet this memorial, “the plaintive tones
of which,” he adds, “appeal direct to the heart,” was
never allowed to reach the Emperor. Twelve years
later, the Minister impeached by Yang Chi-shêng was
dismissed for scandalous abuse of power, and had all his
property confiscated. Being reduced to beggary, he
received from the Emperor a handsome silver bowl in
which to collect alms; but so universally hated was he
that no one would either give him anything or venture
to buy the bowl, and he died of starvation while still in
the possession of wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHÊN SU</div>

<p>A curiously similar case, with a happier ending, was
that of <span class="smcap">Shên Su</span>, who, in the discharge of his duties as
Censor, also denounced the same Minister, before whose
name the word “traitorous” is now always inserted.
Shên Su was thrown into prison, and remained there
for fifteen years. He was released in consequence
of the following memorial by his wife, of which the
commentator says, “for every drop of ink a drop of
blood”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“May it please your Majesty,&mdash;My husband was a
Censor attached to the Board of Rites. For his folly in
recklessly advising your Majesty, he deserved indeed a
thousand deaths; yet under the Imperial clemency he
was doomed only to await his sentence in prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Since then fourteen years have passed away. His
aged parents are still alive, but there are no children in
his hall, and the wretched man has none on whom he can
rely. I alone remain&mdash;a lodger at an inn, working day
and night at my needle to provide the necessaries of life;
encompassed on all sides by difficulties; to whom every
day seems a year.</p>

<p>“My father-in-law is eighty-seven years of age. He
trembles on the brink of the grave. He is like a candle
in the wind. I have naught wherewith to nourish him
alive or to honour him when dead. I am a lone
woman. If I tend the one, I lose the other. If I return
to my father-in-law, my husband will die of starvation.
If I remain to feed him, my father-in-law may die at any
hour. My husband is a criminal bound in gaol. He dares
give no thought to his home. Yet can it be that when
all living things are rejoicing in life under the wise and
generous rule of to-day, we alone should taste the cup of
poverty and distress, and find ourselves beyond the pale
of universal peace?</p>

<p>“Oft, as I think of these things, the desire to die comes
upon me; but I swallow my grief and live on, trusting in
Providence for some happy termination, some moistening
with the dew of Imperial grace. And now that my
father-in-law is face to face with death; now that my
husband can hardly expect to live&mdash;I venture to offer
this body as a hostage, to be bound in prison, while my
husband returns to watch over the last hours of his
father. Then, when all is over, he will resume his place
and await your Majesty’s pleasure. Thus my husband
will greet his father once again, and the feelings of
father and child will be in some measure relieved.
Thus I shall give to my father-in-law the comfort of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
son, and the duty of a wife towards her husband will
be fulfilled.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TSUNG CH’ÊN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsung Ch’ên</span> gained some distinction during this sixteenth
century; in youth, by his great beauty, and especially
by his eyes, which were said to flash fire even at the
sides; later on, by subscribing to the funeral expenses
of the above-mentioned Yang Chi-shêng; and finally, by
his successful defence of Foochow against the Japanese,
whose forces he enticed into the city by a feint of
surrender, and then annihilated from the walls. The
following piece, which, in the opinion of the commentator,
“verges upon trifling,” is from his correspondence.
Several sentences of it have quite a
Juvenalian ring:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I was very glad at this distance to receive your letter,
which quite set my mind at rest, together with the
present you were so kind as to add. I thank you very
much for your good wishes, and especially for your
thoughtful allusion to my father.</p>

<p>“As to what you are pleased to say in reference to
official popularity and fitness for office, I am much
obliged by your remarks. Of my unfitness I am only
too well aware; while as to popularity with my superiors,
I am utterly unqualified to secure that boon.</p>

<p>“How indeed does an official find favour in the
present day with his chief? Morning and evening he
must whip up his horse and go dance attendance at the
great man’s door. If the porter refuses to admit him,
then honeyed words, a coaxing air, and money drawn
from the sleeve, may prevail. The porter takes in his
card; but the great man does not come out. So he
waits in the stable among grooms, until his clothes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
charged with the smell, in spite of hunger, in spite of
cold, in spite of a blazing heat. At nightfall, the porter
who has pocketed the money comes forth and says his
master is tired and begs to be excused, and will he call
again next day. So he is forced to come once more as
requested. He sits all night in his clothes. At cock-crow
he jumps up, performs his toilette, and gallops off
and knocks at the entrance gate. ‘Who’s there?’
shouts the porter angrily; and when he explains, the
porter gets still more angry and begins to abuse him,
saying, ‘You are in a fine hurry, you are! Do you
think my master sees people at this hour?’ Then is
the visitor shamed, but has to swallow his wrath and try
to persuade the porter to let him in. And the porter,
another fee to the good, gets up and lets him in; and
then he waits again in the stable as before, until perhaps
the great man comes out and summons him to an
audience.</p>

<p>“Now, with many an obeisance, he cringes timidly
towards the foot of the daïs steps; and when the great
man says ‘Come!’ he prostrates himself twice and
remains long without rising. At length he goes up to
offer his present, which the great man refuses. He
entreats acceptance; but in vain. He implores, with
many instances; whereupon the great man bids a
servant take it. Then two more prostrations, long
drawn out; after which he arises, and with five or six
salutations he takes his leave.</p>

<p>“On going forth, he bows to the porter, saying, ‘It’s
all right with your master. Next time I come you need
make no delay.’ The porter returns the bow, well
pleased with his share in the business. Meanwhile, our
friend springs on his horse, and when he meets an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
acquaintance flourishes his whip and cries out, ‘I have
just been with His Excellency. He treated me very
kindly, very kindly indeed.’ And then he goes into
detail, upon which his friends begin to be more respectful
to him as a <i>protégé</i> of His Excellency. The great
man himself says, ‘So-and-so is a good fellow, a very
good fellow indeed;’ upon which the bystanders of
course declare that they think so too.</p>

<p>“Such is popularity with one’s superiors in the present
day. Do you think that I could be as one of these?
No! Beyond sending in a complimentary card at the
summer and winter festivals, I do not go near the great
from one year’s end to another. Even when I pass their
doors I stuff my ears and cover my eyes, and gallop
quickly by, as if some one was after me. In consequence
of this want of breadth, I am of course no
favourite with the authorities; but what care I? There
is a destiny that shapes our ends, and it has shaped mine
towards the path of duty alone. For which, no doubt,
you think me an ass.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANG TAO-K’UN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wang Tao-k’un</span> took his third degree in 1547. His
instincts seemed to be all for a soldier’s life, and he rose
to be a successful commander. He found ample time,
however, for books, and came to occupy an honourable
place among contemporary writers. His works, which,
according to one critic, are “polished in style and lofty
in tone,” have been published in a uniform edition, and
are still read. The following is a cynical skit upon the
corruption of his day:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A retainer was complaining to Po Tzŭ that no one
in the district knew how to get on.</p>

<p>“‘You gentlemen,’ said he, ‘are like square handles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
which you would thrust into the round sockets of your
generation. Consequently, there is not one of you which
fits.’</p>

<p>“‘You speak truth,’ replied Po Tzŭ; ‘kindly explain
how this is so.’</p>

<p>“‘There are five reasons,’ said the retainer, ‘why you
are at loggerheads with the age, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘(1) The path to popularity lies straight before you,
but you will not follow it.</p>

<p>“‘(2) Other men’s tongues reach the soft places in
the hearts of their superiors, but your tongues are too
short.</p>

<p>“‘(3) Others eschew fur robes, and approach with
bent backs as if their very clothes were too heavy for
them; but you remain as stiff-necked as planks.</p>

<p>“‘(4) Others respond even before they are called, and
seek to anticipate the wishes of their superiors; whose
enemies, were they the saints above, would not escape
abuse; whose friends, were they highwaymen and
thieves, would be larded over with praise. But you&mdash;you
stick at facts and express opinions adverse to those
of your superiors, whom it is your special interest to
conciliate.</p>

<p>“‘(5) Others make for gain as though bent upon
shooting a pheasant, watching in secret and letting fly
with care, so that nothing escapes their aim. But you&mdash;you
hardly bend your bow, or bend it only to miss the
quarry that lies within your reach.</p>

<p>“‘One of these five failings is like a tumour hanging
to you and impeding your progress in life. How much
more all of them!’</p>

<p>“‘It is indeed as you state,’ answered Po Tzŭ. ‘But
would you bid me cut these tumours away? A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
may have a tumour and live. To cut it off is to die.
And life with a tumour is better than death without.
Besides, beauty is a natural gift; and the woman who
tried to look like Hsi Shih only succeeded in frightening
people out of their wits by her ugliness. Now it is my
misfortune to have these tumours, which make me more
loathsome even than that woman. Still, I can always,
so to speak, stick to my needle and my cooking-pots,
and strive to make my good man happy. There is no
occasion for me to proclaim my ugliness in the market-place.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, sir,’ said the retainer, ‘now I know why there
are so many ugly people about, and so little beauty in
the land.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HSÜ HSIEH</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hsü Hsieh</span> graduated as Senior Classic in 1601, and
received an appointment in the Han-lin College, where
all kinds of State documents are prepared under the
superintendence of eminent scholars. Dying young, he
left behind him the reputation of a cross-grained man,
with whom it was difficult to get along, ardently devoted
to study. He swore that if it were granted to him to
acquire a brilliant style, he would jump into the sea to
circulate his writings. The following piece is much
admired. “It is completed,” says a commentator, “with
the breath of a yawn (with a single effort), and is like a
heavenly robe, without seam. The reader looks in vain
for paragraphing in this truly inspired piece”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For some years I had possessed an old inkstand, left
at my house by a friend. It came into ordinary use as
such, I being unaware that it was an antique. However,
one day a connoisseur told me it was at least a thousand
years old, and urged me to preserve it carefully as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
valuable relic. This I did, but never took any further
trouble to ascertain whether such was actually the case
or not. For supposing that this inkstand really dated
from the period assigned, its then owner must have
regarded it simply as an inkstand. He could not have
known that it was destined to survive the wreck of time
and to come to be cherished as an antique. And while
we prize it now, because it has descended to us from a
distant past, we forget that then, when antiques were
relics of a still earlier period, it could not have been of
any value to antiquarians, themselves the moderns of
what is antiquity to us! The surging crowd around us
thinks of naught but the acquisition of wealth and material
enjoyment, occupied only with the struggle for place
and power. Men lift their skirts and hurry through the
mire; they suffer indignity and feel no sense of shame.
And if from out this mass there arises one spirit purer
and simpler than the rest, striving to tread a nobler path
than they, and amusing his leisure, for his own gratification,
with guitars, and books, and pictures, and other
relics of olden times,&mdash;such a man is indeed a genuine
lover of the antique. He can never be one of the
common herd, though the common herd always affect
to admire whatever is admittedly admirable. In the
same way, persons who aim at advancement in their
career will spare no endeavour to collect the choicest
rarities, in order, by such gifts, to curry favour with their
superiors, who in their turn will take pleasure in ostentatious
display of their collections of antiquities. Such
is but a specious hankering after antiques, arising simply
from a desire to eclipse one’s neighbours. Such men
are not genuine lovers of the antique. Their tastes are
those of the common herd after all, though they make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
great show and filch the reputation of true antiquarians,
in the hope of thus distinguishing themselves from their
fellows, ignorant as they are that what they secure is the
name alone without the reality. The man whom I call
a genuine antiquarian is he who studies the writings of
the ancients, and strives to form himself upon their
model, though unable to greet them in the flesh; who
ever and anon, in his wanderings up and down the long
avenue of the past, lights upon some choice fragment
which brings him in an instant face to face with the
immortal dead. Of such enjoyment there is no satiety.
Those who truly love antiquity, love not the things, but
the men of old, since a relic in the present is much what
it was in the past,&mdash;a mere thing. And so if it is not to
things, but rather to men, that devotion is due, then even
I may aspire to be some day an antique. Who shall say
that centuries hence an antiquarian of the day may not
look up to me as I have looked up to my predecessors?
Should I then neglect myself, and foolishly devote my
energies to trifling with things?</p>

<p>“Such is popular enthusiasm in these matters. It
is shadow without substance. But the theme is endless,
and I shall therefore content myself with a passing
record of my old inkstand.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LI SHIH-CHÊN</div>

<p>This chapter may close with the names of two remarkable
men. <span class="smcap">Li Shih-chên</span> completed in 1578, after twenty-six
years of unremitting labour, his great Materia Medica.
In 1596 the manuscript was laid before the Emperor,
who ordered it to be printed forthwith. It deals (1) with
Inanimate substances; (2) with Plants; and (3) with
Animals, and is illustrated by over 1100 woodcuts. The
introductory chapter passes in review forty-two previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
works of importance on the same subject, enumerating
no fewer than 950 miscellaneous publications on a variety
of subjects. The famous “doctrine of signatures,” which
supposes that the uses of plants and substances are indicated
to man by certain appearances peculiar to them,
figures largely in this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hsü Kuang-ch’i</span> (1562-1634) is generally regarded as
the only influential member of the mandarinate who has
ever become a convert to Christianity. After graduating
first among the candidates for the second degree in 1597
and taking his final degree in 1604, he enrolled himself
as a pupil of Matteo Ricci, and studied under his
guidance to such purpose that he was able to produce
works on the new system of astronomy as introduced
by the Jesuit Fathers, besides various treatises on mathematical
science. He was also author of an encyclopædia
of agriculture of considerable value, first published in
1640. This work is illustrated with numerous woodcuts,
and treats of the processes and implements of husbandry,
of rearing silkworms, of breeding animals, of the manufacture
of food, and even of precautions to be taken
against famine. The Jesuit Fathers themselves scattered
broadcast over China a large number of propagandist
publications, written in polished book-style, some few of
which are still occasionally to be found in old book-shops.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

NOVELS AND PLAYS</h3>


<p>Novels were produced in considerable numbers under
the Ming dynasty, but the names of their writers, except
in a very few cases, have not been handed down. The
marvellous work known as the <cite>Ch’in P’ing Mei</cite>, from the
names of three of the chief female characters, has been
attributed to the grave scholar and statesman, Wang
Shih-chêng (1526-1593); but this is more a guess than
anything else. So also is the opinion that it was produced
in the seventeenth century, as a covert satire upon
the morals of the Court of the great Emperor K’ang Hsi.
The story itself refers to the early part of the twelfth
century, and is written in a simple, easy style, closely
approaching the Peking colloquial. It possesses one
extraordinary characteristic. Many words and phrases
are capable of two interpretations, one of which is of a
class which renders such passages unfit for ears polite.
Altogether the book is objectionable, and would require
a translator with the nerve of a Burton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Yü Chiao Li</cite> is a tale of the fifteenth century which
has found much favour in the eyes of foreigners, partly
because it is of an unusually moderate length. The
ordinary Chinaman likes his novels long, and does not
mind plenty of repetitions after the style of Homer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
which latter feature seems to point in the direction of
stories told by word of mouth and written down later
on, and may be taken in connection with the opinion
already expressed, that the Chinese novel came originally
from Central Asia. Here, however, in four small
volumes, we have a charming story of a young graduate
who falls in love first with a beautiful and accomplished
poetess, and then with the fascinating sister of a fascinating
friend whose acquaintance&mdash;the brother’s&mdash;he
makes casually by the roadside. The friend and the
sister turn out to be one and the same person, a very
lively girl, who appears in male or female dress as
occasion may require; and what is more, the latter
young lady turns out to be the much-loved orphan
cousin of the first and still cherished young lady, and
also her intellectual equal. The graduate is madly in
love with the two girls, and they are irrevocably in love
with him. This is a far simpler matter than it would be
in Western countries. The hero marries both, and all
three live happily ever afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LIEH KUO CHUAN</div>

<p>The <cite>Lieh Kuo Chuan</cite>, anonymous as usual, is a
historical novel dealing with the exciting times of the
Feudal States, and covering the period between the
eighth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> and the union of China under the
First Emperor. It is introduced to the reader in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <cite>Lieh Kuo</cite> is not like an ordinary novel, which
consists mainly of what is not true. Thus the <cite>Fêng
Shên</cite> (a tale of the twelfth century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>), the <cite>Shui Hu</cite>,
the <cite>Hsi Yu Chi</cite>, and others, are pure fabrications.
Even the <cite>San Kuo Chih</cite>, which is very near to truth,
contains much that is without foundation. Not so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
<cite>Lieh Kuo</cite>. There every incident is a real incident, every
speech a real speech. Besides, as there is far more to
tell than could possibly be told, it is not likely that the
writer would go out of his way to invent. Wherefore
the reader must look upon the <cite>Lieh Kuo</cite> as a genuine
history, and not as a mere novel.”</p>

<p>The following extract refers to a bogus exhibition,
planned by the scheming State of Ch’in, nominally to
make a collection of valuables and hand them over as
respectful tribute to the sovereign House of Chou, but
really with a view to a general massacre of the rival
nobles who stood in the way between the Ch’ins and
their treasonable designs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Duke Ai of Ch’in now proceeded with his various
officers of State to prepare a place for the proposed
exhibition, at the same time setting a number of armed
men in ambuscade, with a view to carry out his ambitious
designs; and when he heard that the other nobles had
arrived, he went out and invited them to come in. The
usual ceremonies over, and the nobles having taken
their seats according to precedence, Duke Ai addressed
the meeting as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘I, having reverently received the commission of the
Son of Heaven, do hereby open this assembly for the
exhibition of such valuables as may be brought together
from all parts of the empire, the same to be subsequently
packed together, and forwarded as tribute to our Imperial
master. And since you nobles are now all collected
here in this place, it is fitting that our several exhibits
be forthwith produced and submitted for adjudication.’</p>

<p>“Sounds of assent from the nobles were heard at the
conclusion of this speech, but the Prime Minister of the
Ch’i State, conscious that the atmosphere was heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
laden with the vapour of death, as if from treacherous
ambush, stepped forward and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Of old, when the nobles were wont to assemble, it
was customary to appoint one just and upright member
to act as arbiter or judge of the meeting; and now that
we have thus met for the purposes of this exhibition, I
propose, in the interest of public harmony, that some
one of us be nominated arbiter in a similar way.’</p>

<p>“Duke Ai readily agreed to the above proposition, and
immediately demanded of the assembled nobles who
among them would venture to accept the office indicated.
These words were scarcely out of his mouth when up
rose Pien Chuang, generalissimo of the forces of Chêng,
and declared that he was ready to undertake the post.
Duke Ai then asked him upon what grounds, as to
personal ability, he based his claim; to which Pien
Chuang replied, ‘Of ability I have little indeed, but I
have slain a tiger with one blow of my fist, and in
martial prowess I am second to none. Upon this I
base my claim.’</p>

<p>“Accordingly, Duke Ai called for a golden tablet, and
was on the point of investing him as arbiter of the
exhibition, when a voice was heard from among the
retainers of the Wu State, loudly urging, ‘The slayer of
a tiger need be possessed only of physical courage; but
how is that a sufficient recommendation for this office?
Delay awhile, I pray, until I come and take the tablet
myself.’</p>

<p>“By this time Duke Ai had seen that the speaker was
K’uai Hui, son of the Duke of Wei, and forthwith inquired
of him what his particular claim to the post might be. ‘I
cut the head off a deadly dragon, and for that feat I claim
this post.’ Duke Ai thereupon ordered Pien Chuang to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
transfer to him the golden tablet; but this he refused to
do, arguing that the slaughter of a dragon was simply a
magician’s trick, and not at all to the present purpose.
He added that if the tablet was to be taken from him,
it would necessitate an appeal to force between himself
and his rival. The contest continued thus for some time,
until at length the Prime Minister of Ch’i rose again, and
solved the difficulty in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The slaughter of a tiger involves physical courage,
and the slaughter of a dragon is a magician’s trick;
hence, neither of these acts embraces that combination
of mental and physical power which we desire in the
arbiter of this meeting. Now, in front of the palace
there stands a sacrificial vessel which weighs about a
thousand pounds. Let Duke Ai give out a theme; and
then let him who replies thereto with most clearness and
accuracy, and who can, moreover, seize the aforesaid
vessel, and carry it round the platform on which the
eighteen representative nobles are seated, be nominated
to the post of arbiter and receive the golden tablet.’</p>

<p>“To this plan Duke Ai assented; and writing down a
theme, bade his attendants exhibit it among the heroes
of the assembled States. The theme was in rhyme, and
contained these eight lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Say what supports the sky; say what supports the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is the mystic number which to the universe gave birth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence come the eddying waves of the river’s rolling might?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall we seek the primal germ of the mountain’s towering height?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which of the elements five is the work of Nature done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of all the ten thousand things that are, say which is the wondrous <em class="antiqua">one</em>?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the questions seven which I now propound to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who can answer them straight and well is the trusty man and true.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<p>“The theme had hardly been uttered, when up started
Chi Nien, generalissimo of the Ch’in State, and cried out,
‘This is but a question of natural philosophy; what
difficulty is there in it?’ He thereupon advanced to
the front, and, having obtained permission to compete,
seized a stylus and wrote down the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Nothing supports the sky; nothing supports the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can we guess at the number which to the universe gave birth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the reaches above come the eddying waves of the river’s rolling might:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can we tell where to look for the germ of the mountain’s towering height?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By every one of the elements five is the work of Nature done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of all the ten thousand things that are there is no particular <em class="antiqua">one</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There you have my replies to the questions set by you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the arbiter’s post I hereby claim as the trusty man and true.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Chi Nien, having delivered this answer, proceeded to
tuck up his robe, and, passing to the front of the palace,
seized with both hands the sacrificial vessel, and raised it
some two feet from the ground, his whole face becoming
suffused with colour under the effort. At the same time
there arose a great noise of drums and horns, and all the
assembled nobles applauded loudly; whereupon Duke
Ai personally invested him with the golden tablet and
proclaimed him arbiter of the exhibition, for which Chi
Nien was just about to return thanks, when suddenly
up jumped Wu Yüan, generalissimo of the Ch’u State,
and coming forward, declared in an angry tone that Chi
Nien’s answer did not dispose of the theme in a proper
and final manner; that he had not removed the sacrificial
vessel from its place, and that consequently he
had not earned the appointment which Wu Yüan now
contended should be bestowed upon himself. Duke Ai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
in view of his scheme for seizing the persons of the
various nobles, was naturally anxious that the post of
arbiter should fall to one of his own officers, and was
much displeased at this attempt on the part of Wu Yüan;
however, he replied that if the latter could dispose of
the theme and carry round the sacrificial vessel, the
office of arbiter would be his. Wu Yüan thereupon took
a stylus and indited the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘The earth supports the sky; the sky supports the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em class="antiqua">Five</em> is the mystic number which to the universe gave birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the sky come the eddying waves of the river’s rolling might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the K’un-lun range we must seek the germ of the mountain’s towering height.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By <em class="antiqua">truth</em>, of the elements five, can most good work be done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of all the ten thousand things that are, <em class="antiqua">man</em> is the wondrous one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There you have my replies to the questions set this day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The answers are clear and straight to the point, and given without delay.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“As soon as he had finished writing, he handed his
reply to Duke Ai, who at once saw that he had in every
way disposed of the theme with far greater skill than
Chi Nien, and accordingly now bade him show his
strength upon the sacrificial vessel. Wu Yüan immediately
stepped forward, and, holding up his robe with
his left hand, seized the vessel with his right, raising it up
and bearing it round the platform before the assembled
nobles, and finally depositing it in its original place,
without so much as changing colour. The nobles gazed
at each other in astonishment at this feat, and with one
accord declared him to be the hero of the day; so that
Duke Ai had no alternative but to invest him with the
golden tablet and announce his appointment to the post
of arbiter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHING HUA YÜAN</div>

<p>The <cite>Ching Hua Yüan</cite> is a less pretentious work than
the preceding, but of an infinitely more interesting character.
Dealing with the reign of the Empress Wu, who
in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 684 set aside the rightful heir and placed herself
upon the throne, which she occupied for twenty years,
this work describes how a young graduate, named T’ang,
disgusted with the establishment of examinations and
degrees for women, set out with a small party on a
voyage of exploration. Among all the strange places
which they visited, the most curious was the Country of
Gentlemen, where they landed and proceeded at once to
the capital city.</p>

<p>“There, over the city gate, T’ang and his companions
read the following legend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<i>Virtue is man’s only jewel!</i>’</p></div>

<p>“They then entered the city, which they found to be
a busy and prosperous mart, the inhabitants all talking
the Chinese language. Accordingly, T’ang accosted one
of the passers-by, and asked him how it was his nation
had become so famous for politeness and consideration
of others; but, to his great astonishment, the man did
not understand the meaning of his question. T’ang
then asked him why this land was called the ‘Country
of Gentlemen,’ to which he likewise replied that he did
not know. Several other persons of whom they inquired
giving similar answers, the venerable To remarked that
the term had undoubtedly been adopted by the inhabitants
of adjacent countries, in consequence of the
polite manners and considerate behaviour of these
people. ‘For,’ said he, ‘the very labourers in the fields
and foot-passengers in the streets step aside to make
room for one another. High and low, rich and poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
mutually respect each other’s feelings without reference
to the wealth or social status of either; and this is, after
all, the essence of what constitutes the true gentleman.’</p>

<p>“‘In that case,’ cried T’ang, ‘let us not hurry on, but
rather improve ourselves by observing the ways and
customs of this people.’</p>

<p>“By and by they arrived at the market-place, where
they saw an official runner standing at a stall engaged
in making purchases. He was holding in his hand the
articles he wished to buy, and was saying to the owner
of the stall, ‘Just reflect a moment, sir, how impossible
it would be for me to take these excellent goods at the
absurdly low price you are asking. If you will oblige
me by doubling the amount, I shall do myself the
honour of accepting them; otherwise, I cannot but
feel that you are unwilling to do business with me
to-day.’</p>

<p>“‘How very funny!’ whispered T’ang to his friends.
‘Here, now, is quite a different custom from ours, where
the buyer invariably tries to beat down the seller, and
the seller to run up the price of his goods as high as
possible. This certainly looks like the ‘consideration
for others’ of which we spoke just now.’</p>

<p>“The man at the stall here replied, ‘Your wish, sir,
should be law to me, I know; but the fact is, I am
already overwhelmed with shame at the high price I
have ventured to name. Besides, I do not profess to
adhere rigidly to ‘marked prices,’ which is a mere trick
of the trade, and consequently it should be the aim of
every purchaser to make me lower my terms to the very
smallest figure; you, on the contrary, are trying to raise
the price to an exorbitant figure; and although I fully
appreciate your kindness in that respect, I must really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
ask you to seek what you require at some other establishment.
It is quite impossible for me to execute your
commands.’</p>

<p>“T’ang was again expressing his astonishment at this
extraordinary reversal of the platitudes of trade, when
the would-be purchaser replied, ‘For you, sir, to ask
such a low sum for these first-class goods, and then to
turn round and accuse me of over-considering your
interests, is indeed a sad breach of etiquette. Trade
could not be carried on at all if all the advantages were
on one side and the losses on the other; neither am I
more devoid of brains than the ordinary run of people
that I should fail to understand this principle and let
you catch me in a trap.’</p>

<p>“So they went on wrangling and jangling, the stall-keeper
refusing to charge any more and the runner
insisting on paying his own price, until the latter made
a show of yielding and put down the full sum demanded
on the counter, but took only half the amount of goods.
Of course the stall-keeper would not consent to this,
and they would both have fallen back upon their original
positions had not two old gentlemen who happened to
be passing stepped aside and arranged the matter for
them, by deciding that the runner was to pay the full
price but to receive only four-fifths of the goods.</p>

<p>“T’ang and his companions walked on in silence,
meditating upon the strange scene they had just witnessed;
but they had not gone many steps when they
came across a soldier similarly engaged in buying things
at an open shop-window. He was saying, ‘When I
asked the price of these goods, you, sir, begged me to
take them at my own valuation; but now that I am
willing to do so, you complain of the large sum I offer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
whereas the truth is that it is actually very much below
their real value. Do not treat me thus unfairly.’</p>

<p>“‘It is not for me, sir,’ replied the shopkeeper, ‘to
demand a price for my own goods; my duty is to leave
that entirely to you. But the fact is, that these goods are
old stock, and are not even the best of their kind; you
would do much better at another shop. However, let us
say half what you are good enough to offer; even then
I feel I shall be taking a great deal too much. I could
not think, sir, of parting with my goods at your price.’</p>

<p>“‘What is that you are saying, sir?’ cried the
soldier. ‘Although not in the trade myself, I can tell
superior from inferior articles, and am not likely to
mistake one for the other. And to pay a low price for a
good article is simply another way of taking money out
of a man’s pocket.’</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ retorted the shopkeeper, ‘if you are such a
stickler for justice as all that, let us say half the price
you first mentioned, and the goods are yours. If you
object to that, I must ask you to take your custom elsewhere.
You will then find that I am not imposing on
you.’</p>

<p>“The soldier at first stuck to his text, but seeing that
the shopkeeper was not inclined to give way, he laid
down the sum named and began to take his goods,
picking out the very worst he could find. Here, however,
the shopkeeper interposed, saying, ‘Excuse me, sir,
but you are taking all the bad ones. It is doubtless very
kind of you to leave the best for me, but if all men were
like you there would be a general collapse of trade.’</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ replied the soldier, ‘as you insist on accepting
only half the value of the goods, there is no course open
to me but to choose inferior articles. Besides, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
matter of fact, the best kind will not answer my purpose
so well as the second or third best; and although I fully
recognise your good intentions, I must really ask to be
allowed to please myself.’</p>

<p>“‘There is no objection, sir,’ said the shopkeeper, ‘to
your pleasing yourself, but low-class goods are sold at
a low price, and do not command the same rates as
superior articles.’</p>

<p>“Thus they went on bandying arguments for a long
time without coming to any definite agreement, until at
last the soldier picked up the things he had chosen and
tried to make off with them. The bystanders, however,
all cried shame upon him and said he was a downright
cheat, so that he was ultimately obliged to take some of
the best kind and some of the inferior kind and put an
end to the altercation.</p>

<p>“A little farther on our travellers saw a countryman
who had just paid the price of some purchases he had
succeeded in making, and was hurrying away with them,
when the shopkeeper called after him, ‘Sir! sir! you
have paid me by mistake in finer silver than we are
accustomed to use here, and I have to allow you a considerable
discount in consequence. Of course this is a
mere trifle to a gentleman of your rank and position, but
still for my own sake I must ask leave to make it all
right with you.’</p>

<p>“‘Pray don’t mention such a small matter,’ replied
the countryman, ‘but oblige me by putting the amount
to my credit for use at a future date when I come again
to buy some more of your excellent wares.’</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ answered the shopkeeper, ‘you don’t catch
old birds with chaff. That trick was played upon me
last year by another gentleman, and to this day I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
never set eyes upon him again, though I have made
every endeavour to find out his whereabouts. As it is, I
can now only look forward to repaying him in the next
life; but if I let you take me in in the same way, why,
when the next life comes and I am changed, maybe into
a horse or a donkey, I shall have quite enough to do to
find him, and your debt will go dragging on till the life
after that. No, no, there is no time like the present;
hereafter I might very likely forget what was the exact
sum I owed you.’</p>

<p>“They continued to argue the point until the countryman
consented to accept a trifle as a set-off against the
fineness of his silver, and went away with his goods, the
shopkeeper bawling after him as long as he was in sight
that he had sold him inferior articles at a high rate, and
was positively defrauding him of his money. The
countryman, however, got clear away, and the shopkeeper
returned to his grumbling at the iniquity of the
age. Just then a beggar happened to pass, and so in
anger at having been compelled to take more than his
due he handed him the difference. ‘Who knows,’ said
he, ‘but that the present misery of this poor fellow may
be retribution for overcharging people in a former
life?’</p>

<p>“‘Ah,’ said T’ang, when he had witnessed the finale of
this little drama, ‘truly this is the behaviour of gentlemen!’</p>

<p>“Our travellers then fell into conversation with two
respectable-looking old men who said they were
brothers, and accepted their invitation to go and take a
cup of tea together. Their hosts talked eagerly about
China, and wished to hear many particulars of ‘the first
nation in the world.’ Yet, while expressing their ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>miration
for the high literary culture of its inhabitants
and their unqualified successes in the arts and sciences,
they did not hesitate to stigmatise as unworthy a great
people certain usages which appeared to them deserving
of the utmost censure. They laughed at the superstitions
of Fêng-Shui, and wondered how intelligent men could
be imposed upon year after year by the mountebank
professors of such baseless nonsense. ‘If it is true,’ said
one of them, ‘that the selection of an auspicious day and
a fitting spot for the burial of one’s father or mother is
certain to bring prosperity to the survivors, how can you
account for the fact that the geomancers themselves are
always a low, poverty-stricken lot? Surely they would
begin by appropriating the very best positions themselves,
and so secure whatever good fortune might happen
to be in want of an owner.’</p>

<p>“Then again with regard to bandaging women’s feet
in order to reduce their size. ‘We can see no beauty,’
said they, ‘in such monstrosities as the feet of your
ladies. Small noses are usually considered more attractive
than large ones; but what would be said of a man
who sliced a piece off his own nose in order to reduce
it within proper limits?’</p>

<p>“And thus the hours slipped pleasantly away until it
was time to bid adieu to their new friends and regain
their ship.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">P’ING SHAN LÊNG YEN</div>

<p>The <cite>Chin Ku Ch’i Kuan</cite>, or Marvellous Tales,
Ancient and Modern, is a great favourite with the
romance-reading Chinaman. It is a collection of forty
stories said to have been written towards the close of the
Ming dynasty by the members of a society who held
meetings for that purpose. Translations of many, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
all, of these have been published. The style is easy,
very unlike that of the <cite>P’ing Shan Lêng Yen</cite>, a well-known
novel in what would be called a high-class
literary style, being largely made up of stilted dialogue
and over-elaborated verse composed at the slightest
provocation by the various characters in the story.
These were P’ing and Yen, two young students in love
with Shan and Lêng, two young poetesses who charmed
even more by their literary talent than by their fascinating
beauty. On one occasion a pretended poet, named
Sung, who was a suitor for the hand of Miss Lêng, had
been entertained by her uncle, and after dinner the
party wandered about in the garden. Miss Lêng was
summoned, and when writing materials had been produced,
as usual on such occasions, Mr. Sung was asked
to favour the company with a sonnet. “Excuse me,”
he replied, “but I have taken rather too much wine for
verse-making just now.” “Why,” rejoined Miss Lêng,
“it was after a gallon of wine that Li Po dashed off a
hundred sonnets, and so gained a name which will
live for a thousand generations.” “Of course I could
compose,” said Mr. Sung, “even after drinking, but I
might become coarse. It is better to be fasting, and to
feel quite clear in the head. Then the style is more
finished, and the verse more pleasing.” “Ts’ao Chih,”
retorted Miss Lêng, “composed a sonnet while taking
only seven steps, and his fame will be remembered for
ever. Surely occasion has nothing to do with the matter.”
In the midst of Mr. Sung’s confusion, the uncle proposed
that the former should set a theme for Miss Lêng instead,
to which he consented, and on looking about him caught
sight through the open window of a paper kite, which
he forthwith suggested, hoping in his heart to completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
puzzle the sarcastic young lady. However, in the time
that it takes to drink a cup of tea, she had thrown off the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Cunningly made to look like a bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It cheats fools and little children.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has a body of bamboo, light and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers painted on it, as though something wonderful.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown by the wind it swaggers in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound by a string it is unable to move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not laugh at its sham feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it fell, you would see only a dry and empty frame.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All this was intended in ridicule of Mr. Sung himself
and of his personal appearance, and is a fair sample of
what the reader may expect throughout.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Erh Tou Mei</cite>, or “Twice Flowering Plum-trees,”
belongs to the sixteenth or seventeenth century, and is
by an unknown author. It is a novel with a purpose,
being apparently designed to illustrate the beauty of filial
piety, the claims of friendship, and duty to one’s neighbour
in general. Written in a simple style, with no
wealth of classical allusion to soothe the feelings of the
pedant, it contains several dramatic scenes, and altogether
forms a good panorama of Chinese everyday life. Two
heroes are each in love with two heroines, and just as
in the <cite>Yü Chiao Li</cite>, each hero marries both. There is
a slender thread of fact running through the tale, the
action of which is placed in the eighth century, and
several of the characters are actually historical. One
of the four lovely heroines, in order to keep peace between
China and the Tartar tribes which are continually
harrying the borders, decides to sacrifice herself on the
altar of patriotism and become the bride of the Khan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
The parting at the frontier is touchingly described; but
the climax is reached when, on arrival at her destination,
she flings herself headlong over a frightful precipice,
rather than pass into the power of the hated barbarian,
a waiting-maid being dressed up in her clothes and
handed over to the unsuspecting Khan. She herself does
not die. Caught upon a purple cloud, she is escorted
back to her own country by a bevy of admiring angels.</p>

<p>There is also an effective scene, from which the title of
the book is derived, when the plum trees, whose flowers
had been scattered by a storm of wind and rain, gave
themselves up to fervent prayer. “The Garden Spirit
heard their earnest supplications, and announced them
to the Guardian Angel of the town, who straightway
flew up to heaven and laid them at the feet of God.”
The trees were then suffered to put forth new buds, and
soon bloomed again, more beautiful than ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The production of plays was well sustained through
the Ming dynasty, for the simple reason that the Drama,
whether an exotic or a development within the boundaries
of the Middle Kingdom, had emphatically come to
stay. It had caught on, and henceforth forms the ideal
pastime of the cultured, reflective scholar, and of the
laughter-loving masses of the Chinese people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KAO TSÊ-CH’ÊNG</div>

<p>The <cite>P’i Pa Chi</cite>, or “Story of the Guitar,” stands easily
at the head of the list, being ranked by some admirers
as the very finest of all Chinese plays. It is variously
arranged in various editions under twenty-four or forty-two
scenes; and many liberties have been taken with the
text, long passages having been interpolated and many
other changes made. It was first performed in 1704,
and was regarded as a great advance in the dramatic art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
upon the early plays of the Mongols. The author’s name
was <span class="smcap">Kao Tsê-ch’êng</span>, and his hero is said to have been
taken from real life in the person of a friend who actually
rose from poverty to rank and affluence. The following
is an outline of the plot.</p>

<p>A brilliant young graduate and his beautiful wife are
living, as is customary, with the husband’s parents. The
father urges the son to go to the capital and take his
final degree. “At fifteen,” says the old man, “study; at
thirty, act.” The mother, however, is opposed to this
plan, and declares that they cannot get along without
their son. She tells a pitiful tale of another youth who
went to the capital, and after infinite suffering was appointed
Master of a Workhouse, only to find that his
parents had already preceded him thither in the capacity
of paupers. The young man finally decides to do his
duty to the Son of Heaven, and forthwith sets off, leaving
the family to the kind care of a benevolent friend. He
undergoes the examination, which in the play is turned
into ridicule, and comes out in the coveted position of
Senior Classic. The Emperor then instructs one of his
Ministers to take the Senior Classic as a son-in-law; but
our hero refuses, on the ground, so it is whispered,
that the lady’s feet are too large. The Minister is
then compelled to put on pressure, and the marriage
is solemnised, this part of the play concluding with an
effective scene, in which on being asked by his new wife
to sing, our hero suggests such songs as “Far from his
True Love,” and others in a similar style. Even when
he agrees to sing “The Wind through the Pines,” he
drops unwittingly into “Oh for my home once more;”
and then when recalled to his senses, he relapses again
into a song about a deserted wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile misfortunes have overtaken the family left
behind. There has been a famine, the public granaries
have been discovered to be empty instead of full, and
the parents and wife have been reduced to starvation.
The wife exerts herself to the utmost, selling all her
jewels to buy food; and when at length, after her
mother-in-law’s death, her father-in-law dies too, she
cuts off her hair and tries to sell it in order to buy
a coffin, being prevented only by the old friend who
has throughout lent what assistance he could. The next
thing is to raise a tumulus over the grave. This she
tries to do with her own hands, but falls asleep from
fatigue. The Genius of the Hills sees her in this state,
and touched by her filial devotion, summons the white
monkey of the south and the black tiger of the north,
spirits who, with the aid of their subordinates, complete
the tumulus in less than no time. On awaking, she recognises
supernatural intervention, and then determines
to start for the capital in search of her husband, against
whom she entertains very bitter feelings. She first sets
to work to paint the portraits of his deceased parents,
and then with these for exhibition as a means of obtaining
alms, and with her guitar, she takes her departure.
Before her arrival the husband has heard by a letter,
forged in order to get a reward, that his father and
mother are both well, and on their way to rejoin him.
He therefore goes to a temple to pray Buddha for a safe
conduct, and there picks up the rolled-up pictures of his
father and mother which have been dropped by his wife,
who has also visited the temple to ask for alms. The
picture is sent unopened to his study. And now the
wife, in continuing her search, accidentally gains admission
to her husband’s house, and is kindly received by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the second wife. After a few misunderstandings the truth
comes out, and the second wife, who is in full sympathy
with the first, recommends her to step into the study and
leave a note for the husband. This note, in the shape
of some uncomplimentary verses, is found by the latter
together with the pictures which have been hung up
against the wall; the second wife introduces the first;
there is an explanation; and the curtain, if there was
such a thing in a Chinese theatre, would fall upon the
final happiness of the husband and his two wives.</p>

<p>Of course, in the above sketch of a play, which is about
as long as one of Shakespeare’s, a good many side-touches
have been left out. Its chief beauties, according
to Chinese critics, are to be found in the glorification
of duty to the sovereign, of filial piety to a husband’s
parents, and of accommodating behaviour on the part of
the second wife tending so directly to the preservation
of peace under complicated circumstances. The forged
letter is looked upon as a weak spot, as the hero would
know his father’s handwriting, and so with other points
which it has been suggested should be cut out. “But
because a stork’s neck is too long,” says an editor, “you
can’t very well remedy the defect by taking a piece off.”
On the other hand, the pathetic character of the play
gives it a high value with the Chinese; for, as we are
told in the prologue, “it is much easier to make people
laugh than cry.” And if we can believe all that is said
on this score, every successive generation has duly paid
its tribute of tears to the <cite>P’i Pa Chi</cite>.</p>

POETRY</h3>


<div class="sidenote">HSIEH CHIN</div>

<p>Though the poetry of the Ming dynasty shows little
falling off, in point of mere volume, there are far fewer
great poets to be found than under the famous Houses of
T’ang and Sung. The name, however, which stands first
in point of chronological sequence, is one which is widely
known. <span class="smcap">Hsieh Chin</span> (1369-1415) was born when the
dynasty was but a year old, and took his final degree
before he had passed the age of twenty. His precocity
had already gained for him the reputation of being an
Inspired Boy, and, later on, the Emperor took such a
fancy to him, that while Hsieh Chin was engaged in
writing, his Majesty would often deign to hold the ink-slab.
He was President of the Commission which
produced the huge encyclopædia already described,
but he is now chiefly known as the author of what
appears to be a didactic poem of about 150 lines,
which may be picked up at any bookstall. It is necessary
to say “about 150 lines,” since no two editions
give identically the same number of lines, or even the
same text to each line. It is also very doubtful if
Hsieh Chin actually wrote such a poem. In many
editions, lines are boldly stolen from the early Han
poetry and pitchforked in without rhyme or reason,
thus making the transitions even more awkward than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
they otherwise would be. All editors seem to be agreed
upon the four opening lines, which state that the Son of
Heaven holds heroes in high esteem, that his Majesty
urges all to study diligently, and that everything in this
world is second-class, with the sole exception of book-learning.
It is in fact the old story that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Learning is better than house or land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when house and land are gone and spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then learning is most excellent.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Farther on we come to four lines often quoted as enumerating
the four greatest happinesses in life, to wit,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A gentle rain after long drought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting an old friend in a foreign clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joys of the wedding-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One’s name on the list of successful candidates.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above lines occur <i>à propos</i> of nothing in particular,
and are closely followed in some editions by more
precepts on the subject of earnest application. Then
after reading that the Classics are the best fields to
cultivate, we come upon four lines with a dash of real
poetry in them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Man in his youth-time’s rosy glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pink peach flowering in the glade....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, yearly, when spring breezes blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Does each one flush a deeper shade?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More injunctions to burn the midnight oil are again
strangely followed by a suggestion that three cups of
wine induce serenity of mind, and that if a man is but
dead drunk, all his cares disappear, which is only another
way of saying that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The best of life is but intoxication.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>
<p>Altogether, this poem is clearly a patchwork, of which
some parts may have come from Hsieh Chin’s pen.
Here is a short poem of his in defence of official
venality, about which there is no doubt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In vain hands bent on sacrifice<br /></span>
<span class="i10">or clasped in prayer we see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways of God are not exactly<br /></span>
<span class="i10">what those ways should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swindler and the ruffian<br /></span>
<span class="i10">lead pleasant lives enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While judgments overtake the good<br /></span>
<span class="i10">and many a sharp rebuff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swaggering bully stalks along<br /></span>
<span class="i10">as blithely as you please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While those who never miss their prayers<br /></span>
<span class="i10">are martyrs to disease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if great God Almighty fails<br /></span>
<span class="i10">to keep the balance true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can we hope that paltry<br /></span>
<span class="i10">mortal magistrates will do?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The writer came to a tragic end. By supporting the
claim of the eldest prince to be named heir apparent,
he made a lasting enemy of another son, who succeeded
in getting him banished on one charge, and then imprisoned
on a further charge. After four years’ confinement
he was made drunk, probably without much
difficulty, and was buried under a heap of snow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Emperor who reigned between 1522 and 1566 as
the eleventh of his line was not a very estimable personage,
especially in the latter years of his life, when he
spent vast sums over palaces and temples, and wasted
most of his time in seeking after the elixir of life. In
1539 he despatched General Mao to put down a rising in
Annam, and gave him an autograph poem as a send-off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
The verses are considered spirited by Chinese critics,
and are frequently given in collections, which certainly
would not be the case if Imperial authorship was their
only claim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Southward, in all the panoply<br /></span>
<span class="i8">of cruel war arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, our heroic general points<br /></span>
<span class="i8">and waves his glittering blade!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the hills and streams<br /></span>
<span class="i8">the lizard-drums terrific roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While glint of myriad banners<br /></span>
<span class="i8">flashes high from pole to pole....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, scion of the Unicorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">and prove thy heavenly birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crush to all eternity<br /></span>
<span class="i8">these insects of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when thou com’st, a conqueror,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">from those wild barbarian lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">WE will unhitch thy war-cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i8">with our own Imperial hands!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The courtesans of ancient and mediæval China
formed a class which now seems no longer to exist.
Like the <i>hetairæ</i> of Greece, they were often highly
educated, and exercised considerable influence. Biographies
of the most famous of these ladies are in
existence, extending back to the seventh century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
The following is an extract from that of Hsieh Su-su,
who flourished in the fourteenth century, and “with
whom but few of the beauties of old could compare”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Su-su’s beauty was of a most refined style, with a
captivating sweetness of voice and grace of movement.
She was a skilful artist, sweeping the paper with a few
rapid touches, which produced such speaking effects
that few, even of the first rank, could hope to excel her
work. She was a fine horsewoman, and could shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
from horseback with a cross-bow. She would fire one
pellet, and then a second, which would catch up the first
and smash it to atoms in mid-air. Or she would throw
a pellet on to the ground, and then grasping the cross-bow
in her left hand, with her right hand passed behind
her back, she would let fly and hit it, not missing once
in a hundred times. She was also very particular about
her friends, receiving no one unless by his talents he had
made some mark in the world.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHAO TS’AI-CHI&mdash;CHAO LI-HUA</div>

<p>The poetical effusions, and even plays, of many of
these ladies have been carefully preserved, and are
usually published as a supplement to any dynastic collection.
Here is a specimen by <span class="smcap">Chao Ts’ai-chi</span> (fifteenth
century), of whom no biography is extant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The tide in the river beginning to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the sad hour of parting, brings tears to our eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! that these furlongs of willow-strings gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot hold fast the boat that will soon be away!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another specimen, by a lady named <span class="smcap">Chao Li-hua</span>
(sixteenth century), contains an attempt at a pun, which
is rather lamely brought out in the translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Your notes on paper; rare to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Two flying joy-birds bear;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be like the birds and fly to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not like the paper, rare!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These examples sufficiently illustrate this small department
of literature, which, if deficient in work of real
merit, at any rate contains nothing of an indelicate
character.</p>

<p>A wild harum-scarum young man was <span class="smcap">Fang Shu-shao</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
who, like many other Chinese poets, often took more
wine than was good for him. He was famed for his
poetry, and also for his calligraphy, specimens of his art
being highly prized by collectors. In 1642, we are told,
“he was ill with his teeth;” and at length got into his
coffin, which all Chinese like to keep handy, and wrote a
farewell to the world, resting his paper on the edge of
the coffin as he wrote. On completion of the piece he
laid himself down and died. Here are the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“An eternal home awaits me;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">shall I hesitate to go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or struggle for a few more hours<br /></span>
<span class="i10">of fleeting life below?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A home wherein the clash of arms<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I can never hear again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shall I strive to linger<br /></span>
<span class="i10">in this thorny world of pain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breeze will soon blow cool o’er me,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">and the bright moon shine o’erhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When blended with the gems of earth<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I lie in my last bed.<br /></span>

<span class="i10">inside my funeral hearse,<br /></span>

<h2>BOOK THE EIGHTH<br />

<span class="smaller"><i>THE MANCHU DYNASTY</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1644-1900)</span></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

THE “LIAO CHAI”&mdash;THE “HUNG LOU MÊNG”</h3>


<p>By 1644 the glories of the great Ming dynasty had
departed. Misgovernment, referred by Chinese writers
to the ascendency of eunuchs, had resulted in rebellion,
and the rebel chief with a large army was pressing upon
the capital. On the 9th April Peking fell. During the
previous night the Emperor, who had refused to flee,
slew the eldest Princess, commanded the Empress to
commit suicide, and sent his three sons into hiding.
At dawn the bell was struck for the Court to assemble;
but no one came. His Majesty then ascended the Wan
Sui Hill in the palace grounds, and wrote on the lapel
of his robe a last decree:&mdash;“We, poor in virtue and of
contemptible personality, have incurred the wrath of
God on high. My Ministers have deceived me. I am
ashamed to meet my ancestors; and therefore I myself
take off my crown, and, with my hair covering my face,
await dismemberment at the hands of the rebels. Do
not hurt a single one of my people!” He then hanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
himself, as did one faithful eunuch. At this juncture
the Chinese commander-in-chief made overtures to the
Manchu Tartars, who had long been consolidating their
forces, and were already a serious menace to China. An
agreement was hurriedly entered into, and Peking was
retaken. The Manchus took possession definitively
of the throne, which they had openly claimed since
1635, and imposed the “pigtail” upon the Chinese
people.</p>

<p>Here then was the great empire of China, bounded
by the Four Seas, and stretching to the confines of the
habitable earth, except for a few barbarian islands scattered
on its fringe, with its refined and scholarly people,
heirs to a glorious literature more than twenty centuries
old, in the power of a wild race of herdsmen, whose
title had been established by skill in archery and horsemanship.
Not much was to be expected on behalf of
the “humanities” from a people whose own written
language had been composed to order so late as 1599,
and whose literary instincts had still to be developed.
Yet it may be said without fear of contradiction that no
age ever witnessed anything like the extensive encouragement
of literature and patronage of literary men exhibited
under the reigns of two Emperors of this dynasty.
Of this, however, in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The literature of this dynasty may be said to begin
with a writer who was after all but a mere storyteller.
It has already been stated that novels and plays are not
included by the Chinese in the domain of pure literature.
Such is the rule, to which there is in practice, if not in
theory, one very notable exception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">P’U SUNG-LING</div>

<p><span class="smcap">P’u Sung-ling</span>, author of the <cite>Liao Chai Chih I</cite>, which
may be conveniently rendered by “Strange Stories,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
was born in 1622, and took his first degree in 1641.
Though an excellent scholar and a most polished writer,
he failed, as many other good men have done, to take
the higher degrees by which he had hoped to enter
upon an official career. It is generally understood that
this failure was due to neglect of the beaten track of
academic study. At any rate, his disappointment was
overwhelming. All else that we have on record of P’u
Sung-ling, besides the fact that he lived in close companionship
with several eminent scholars of the day, is
gathered from his own words, written when, in 1679, he
laid down his pen upon the completion of a task which
was to raise him within a short period to a foremost
rank in the Chinese world of letters. The following are
extracts from this record:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Clad in wistaria, girdled with ivy,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;thus sang Ch’ü
Yüan in his <cite>Li Sao</cite>. Of ox-headed devils and serpent
gods, he of the long nails<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> never wearied to tell.
Each interprets in his own way the music of heaven;
and whether it be discord or not, depends upon antecedent
causes. As for me, I cannot, with my poor
autumn firefly’s light, match myself against the hobgoblins
of the age.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I am but the dust in the sunbeam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
a fit laughing-stock for devils.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> For my talents are not
those of Yü Pao,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> elegant explorer of the records of the
gods; I am rather animated by the spirit of Su Tung-p’o,
who loved to hear men speak of the supernatural. I get
people to commit what they tell me to writing, and subsequently
I dress it up in the form of a story; and thus
in the lapse of time my friends from all quarters have
supplied me with quantities of material, which, from my
habit of collecting, has grown into a vast pile.</p>

<p>“When the bow<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was hung at my father’s door, he
dreamed that a sickly-looking Buddhist priest, but half-covered
by his stole, entered the chamber. On one of
his breasts was a round piece of plaster like a <i>cash</i>; and
my father, waking from sleep, found that I, just born,
had a similar black patch on my body. As a child, I was
thin and constantly ailing, and unable to hold my own
in the battle of life. Our home was chill and desolate as
a monastery; and working there for my livelihood with
my pen, I was as poor as a priest with his alms-bowl.
Often and often I put my hand to my head and exclaimed,
‘Surely he who sat with his face to the wall<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
in a previous state of existence;’ and thus I referred my
non-success in this life to the influence of a destiny surviving
from the last. I have been tossed hither and
thither in the direction of the ruling wind, like a flower
falling in filthy places; but the six paths<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of transmigration
are inscrutable indeed, and I have no right to complain.
As it is, midnight finds me with an expiring lamp,
while the wind whistles mournfully without; and over my
cheerless table I piece together my tales, vainly hoping
to produce a sequel to the <cite>Infernal Regions</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> With a
bumper I stimulate my pen, yet I only succeed thereby
in ‘venting my excited feelings,’ and as I thus commit
my thoughts to writing, truly I am an object worthy of
commiseration. Alas! I am but the bird that, dreading
the winter frost, finds no shelter in the tree, the autumn
insect that chirps to the moon and hugs the door for
warmth. For where are they who know me? They are
‘in the bosky grove and at the frontier pass’<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;wrapped
in an impenetrable gloom!”</p>

<p>For many years these “Strange Stories” circulated
only in manuscript. P’u Sung-ling, as we are told in a
colophon by his grandson to the first edition, was too
poor to meet the heavy expense of block-cutting; and it
was not until so late as 1740, when the author must have
been already for some time a denizen of the dark land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
he so much loved to describe, that his aforesaid grandson
printed and published the collection now so universally
famous. Since then many editions have been laid before
the Chinese public, the best of which is that by Tan
Ming-lun, a Salt Commissioner, who flourished during
the reign of Tao Kuang, and who in 1842 produced, at
his own expense, an excellent edition in sixteen small
octavo volumes of about 160 pages each.</p>

<p>Any reader of these stories as transferred into another
language might fairly turn round and ask the why and
the wherefore of the profound admiration&mdash;to use a mild
term&mdash;which is universally accorded to them by the
literati of China. The answer is to be found in the
incomparable style in which even the meanest of them
is arrayed. All the elements of form which make for
beauty in Chinese composition are there in overwhelming
force. Terseness is pushed to its extreme limits; each
particle that can be safely dispensed with is scrupulously
eliminated, and every here and there some new and
original combination invests perhaps a single word with
a force it could never have possessed except under the
hands of a perfect master of his art. Add to the above
copious allusions and adaptations from a course of reading
which would seem to have been co-extensive with
the whole range of Chinese literature, a wealth of metaphor
and an artistic use of figures generally, to which
only the writings of Carlyle form an adequate parallel,
and the result is a work which for purity and beauty of
style is now universally accepted in China as among the
best and most perfect models. Sometimes the story runs
plainly and smoothly enough, but the next moment we
may be plunged into pages of abstruse text, the meaning
of which is so involved in quotations from and allusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to the poetry or history of the past three thousand years
as to be recoverable only after diligent perusal of the
commentary, and much searching in other works of
reference.</p>

<p>Premising that, according to one editor, the intention
of most of these stories is to “glorify virtue and to censure
vice,” the following story, entitled “The Talking Pupils,”
may be taken as a fair illustration of the extent to which
this pledge is redeemed:&mdash;</p>

<p>“At Ch’ang-an there lived a scholar named Fang
Tung, who, though by no means destitute of ability, was
a very unprincipled rake, and in the habit of following
and speaking to any woman he might chance to meet.
The day before the spring festival of Clear Weather he
was strolling about outside the city when he saw a small
carriage with red curtains and an embroidered awning,
followed by a crowd of waiting-maids on horseback,
one of whom was exceedingly pretty and riding on a
small palfrey. Going closer to get a better view, Mr. Fang
noticed that the carriage curtain was partly open, and
inside he beheld a beautifully dressed girl of about sixteen,
lovely beyond anything he had ever seen. Dazzled
by the sight, he could not take his eyes off her, and
now before, now behind, he followed the carriage for
many a mile. By and by he heard the young lady call
out to her maid, and, when the latter came alongside,
say to her, ‘Let down the screen for me. Who is this
rude fellow that keeps on staring so?’ The maid
accordingly let down the screen, and looking angrily
at Mr. Fang, said to him, ‘This is the bride of the
Seventh Prince in the City of Immortals going home
to see her parents, and no village girl that you should
stare at her thus.’ Then taking a handful of dust she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
threw it at him and blinded him. He rubbed his eyes
and looked round, but the carriage and horses were
gone. This frightened him, and he went off home, feeling
very uncomfortable about the eyes. He sent for a
doctor to examine them, and on the pupils was found
a small film, which had increased by next morning, the
eyes watering incessantly all the time. The film went
on growing, and in a few days was as thick as a <i>cash</i>.
On the right pupil there came a kind of spiral, and as
no medicine was of any avail, the sufferer gave himself
up to grief and wished for death. He then bethought
himself of repenting of his misdeeds, and hearing that
the <cite>Kuang-ming sûtra</cite> could relieve misery, he got a copy
and hired a man to teach it to him. At first it was very
tedious work, but by degrees he became more composed,
and spent every evening in a posture of devotion, telling
his beads. At the end of a year he had arrived at a state
of perfect calm, when one day he heard a small voice,
about as loud as a fly’s, calling out from his left eye,
‘It’s horridly dark in here.’ To this he heard a
reply from the right eye, saying, ‘Let us go out for a
stroll, and cheer ourselves up a bit.’ Then he felt
a wriggling in his nose which made it itch, just as
if something was going out of each of his nostrils,
and after a while he felt it again as if going the
other way. Afterwards he heard a voice from one
eye say, ‘I hadn’t seen the garden for a long time;
the epidendrums are all withered and dead.’ Now Mr.
Fang was very fond of these epidendrums, of which he
had planted a great number, and had been accustomed
to water them himself, but since the loss of his sight
he had never even alluded to them. Hearing, however,
these words, he at once asked his wife why she had let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
epidendrums die. She inquired how he knew they were
dead, and when he told her, she went out to see, and
found them actually withered away. They were both
very much astonished at this, and his wife proceeded to
conceal herself in the room. She then observed two
tiny people, no bigger than a bean, come down from
her husband’s nose and run out of the door, where she
lost sight of them. In a little while they came back
and flew up to his face, like bees or beetles seeking their
nests. This went on for some days until Mr. Fang
heard from the left eye, ‘This roundabout road is not
at all convenient. It would be as well for us to make a
door.’ To this the right eye answered, ‘My wall is too
thick; it wouldn’t be at all an easy job.’ ‘I’ll try and
open mine,’ said the left eye, ‘and then it will do for
both of us.’ Whereupon Mr. Fang felt a pain in his
left eye as if something was being split, and in a moment
he found he could see the tables and chairs in the room.
He was delighted at this, and told his wife, who examined
his eye and discovered an opening in the film,
through which she could see the black pupil shining
out beneath, the eyeball itself looking like a cracked
peppercorn. By next morning the film had disappeared,
and when his eye was closely examined it was observed to
contain two pupils. The spiral on the right eye remained
as before, and then they knew that the two pupils had
taken up their abode in one eye. Further, although Mr.
Fang was still blind of one eye, the sight of the other was
better than that of the two together. From this time he
was more careful of his behaviour, and acquired in his
part of the country the reputation of a virtuous man.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To take another specimen, this time with a dash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
humour in it. A certain man, named Wang (<i>anglicè</i>
Smith), decided to study Tao&mdash;in other words, the black
art&mdash;at a temple of the Taoist persuasion. The priest,
who seems to have had a touch of Squeers in his composition,
warned Wang that he would probably not be
able to stand the training; but on the latter insisting,
the priest allowed him to join the other novices, and
then sent him to chop wood. He was kept at this task
so long that, although he managed to witness several
extraordinary feats of magical skill performed by the
priest, he scarcely felt that he was making progress
himself.</p>

<p>“After a time he could not stand it any longer; and
as the priest taught him no magical arts, he determined
not to wait, but went to him and said, ‘Sir, I travelled
many long miles for the benefit of your instruction. If
you will not teach me the secret of immortality, let me,
at any rate, learn some trifling trick, and thus soothe my
cravings for a knowledge of your art. I have now been
here two or three months, doing nothing but chop firewood,
out in the morning and back at night, work to
which I was never accustomed in my own home.’
‘Did I not tell you,’ replied the priest, ‘that you
would never support the fatigue? To-morrow I will
start you on your way home.’ ‘Sir,’ said Wang, ‘I
have worked for you a long time. Teach me some small
art, that my coming here may not have been wholly in
vain.’ ‘What art?’ asked the priest. ‘Well,’ answered
Wang, ‘I have noticed that whenever you walk about
anywhere, walls and so on are no obstacle to you. Teach
me this, and I’ll be satisfied.’ The priest laughingly
assented, and taught Wang a formula which he bade
him recite. When he had done so he told him to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
through the wall; but Wang, seeing the wall in front of
him, didn’t like to walk at it. As, however, the priest
bade him try, he walked quietly up to it and was there
stopped. The priest here called out, ‘Don’t go so
slowly. Put your head down and rush at it.’ So Wang
stepped back a few paces and went at it full speed; and
the wall yielding to him as he passed, in a moment he
found himself outside. Delighted at this, he went in to
thank the priest, who told him to be careful in the use
of his power, or otherwise there would be no response,
handing him at the same time some money for his
expenses on the way. When Wang got home, he went
about bragging of his Taoist friends and his contempt for
walls in general; but as his wife disbelieved his story,
he set about going through the performance as before.
Stepping back from the wall, he rushed at it full speed
with his head down; but coming in contact with the
hard bricks, finished up in a heap on the floor. His wife
picked him up and found he had a bump on his forehead
as big as a large egg, at which she roared with laughter;
but Wang was overwhelmed with rage and shame, and
cursed the old priest for his base ingratitude.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Episodes with a familiar ring about them are often to
be found embedded in this collection. For instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>“She then became a dense column of smoke curling
up from the ground, when the priest took an uncorked
gourd and threw it right into the midst of the smoke. A
sucking noise was heard, and the whole column was
drawn into the gourd; after which the priest corked it
up closely and put it in his pouch.”</p>

<p>Of such points the following story contains another
good example:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>“A countryman was one day selling his pears in the
market. They were unusually sweet and fine flavoured,
and the price he asked was high. A Taoist priest in rags
and tatters stopped at the barrow and begged one of
them. The countryman told him to go away, but as he
did not do so, he began to curse and swear at him. The
priest said, ‘You have several hundred pears on your
barrow; I ask for a single one, the loss of which, sir,
you would not feel. Why then get angry?’ The
lookers-on told the countryman to give him an inferior
one and let him go; but this he obstinately refused to do.
Thereupon the beadle of the place, finding the commotion
too great, purchased a pear and handed it to the priest.
The latter received it with a bow, and turning to the crowd
said, ‘We who have left our homes and given up all
that is dear to us, are at a loss to understand selfish,
niggardly conduct in others. Now I have some exquisite
pears which I shall do myself the honour to put before
you.’ Here somebody asked, ‘Since you have pears
yourself why don’t you eat those?’ ‘Because,’ replied
the priest, ‘I wanted one of these pips to grow them
from.’ So saying he munched up the pear; and when
he had finished took a pip in his hand, unstrapped a
pick from his back, and proceeded to make a hole in
the ground several inches deep, wherein he deposited
the pip, filling in the earth as before. He then asked the
bystanders for a little hot water to water it with, and
one among them who loved a joke fetched him some
boiling water from a neighbouring shop. The priest
poured this over the place where he had made the hole,
and every eye was fixed upon him when sprouts were
seen shooting up, and gradually growing larger and
larger. By and by there was a tree with branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
sparsely covered with leaves; then flowers, and last of
all fine, large, sweet-smelling pears hanging in great
profusion. These the priest picked and handed round
to the assembled crowd until all were gone, when he
took his pick and hacked away for a long time at the
tree, finally cutting it down. This he shouldered, leaves
and all, and sauntered quietly away. Now from the
very beginning our friend the countryman had been
amongst the crowd, straining his neck to see what was
going on, and forgetting all about his business. At the
departure of the priest he turned round and discovered
that every one of his pears was gone. He then knew
that those the old fellow had been giving away so freely
were really his own pears. Looking more closely at the
barrow, he also found that one of the handles was
missing, evidently having been newly cut off. Boiling
with rage, he set out in pursuit of the priest, and just
as he turned the corner he saw the lost barrow-handle
lying under the wall, being, in fact, the very pear-tree
that the priest had cut down. But there were no traces
of the priest, much to the amusement of the crowd in
the market-place.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here again is a scene, the latter part of which would
almost justify the belief that Mr. W. S. Gilbert was a
student of Chinese, and had borrowed some of his best
points in “Sweethearts” from the author of the <cite>Liao
Chai</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Next day Wang strolled into the garden, which was of
moderate size, with a well-kept lawn and plenty of trees
and flowers. There was also an arbour consisting of
three posts with a thatched roof, quite shut in on all
sides by the luxuriant vegetation. Pushing his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
among the flowers, Wang heard a noise from one of
the trees, and looking up saw Ying-ning, who at once
burst out laughing and nearly fell down. ‘Don’t!
don’t!’ cried Wang, ‘you’ll fall!’ Then Ying-ning
came down, giggling all the time, until, when she was
near the ground, she missed her hold and tumbled
down with a run. This stopped her merriment, and
Wang picked her up, gently squeezing her hand as he
did so. Ying-ning began laughing again, and was
obliged to lean against a tree for support, it being some
time before she was able to stop. Wang waited till she
had finished, and then drew the flower out of his sleeve
and handed it to her. ‘It’s dead,’ said she; ‘why do you
keep it?’ ‘You dropped it, cousin, at the Feast of
Lanterns,’ replied Wang, ‘and so I kept it.’ She then
asked him what was his object in keeping it, to which he
answered, ‘To show my love, and that I have not forgotten
you. Since that day when we met I have been
very ill from thinking so much of you, and am quite
changed from what I was. But now that it is my
unexpected good fortune to meet you, I pray you have
pity on me.’ ‘You needn’t make such a fuss about a
trifle,’ replied she, ‘and with your own relatives too.
I’ll give orders to supply you with a whole basketful
of flowers when you go away.’ Wang told her she
did not understand, and when she asked what it was
she didn’t understand, he said, ‘I didn’t care for the
flower itself; it was the person who picked the flower.’
‘Of course,’ answered she, ‘everybody cares for their
relations; you needn’t have told me that.’ ‘I wasn’t
talking about ordinary relations,’ said Wang, ‘but about
husbands and wives.’ ‘What’s the difference?’ asked
Ying-ning. ‘Why,’ replied Wang, ‘husband and wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
are always together.’ ‘Just what I shouldn’t like,’ cried
she, ‘to be always with anybody.’”</p>

<p>The pair were ultimately united, and lived happily
ever afterwards, in spite of the fact that the young lady
subsequently confessed that she was the daughter of a
fox, and exhibited supernatural powers. On one occasion
these powers stood her in good stead. Being very
fond of flowers, she went so far as to pick from a neighbour’s
tree.</p>

<p>“One day the owner saw her, and gazed at her some
time in rapt astonishment; however, she didn’t move,
deigning only to laugh. The gentleman was much
smitten with her; and when she smilingly descended
the wall on her own side, pointing all the time with
her finger to a spot hard by, he thought she was
making an assignation. So he presented himself at
nightfall at the same place, and sure enough Ying-ning
was there. Seizing her hand to tell his passion, he
found that he was grasping only a log of wood which
stood against the wall; and the next thing he knew
was that a scorpion had stung him violently on the
finger. There was an end of his romance, except that
he died of the wound during the night.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one of the stories a visitor at a temple is much
struck by a fresco painting containing the picture of a
lovely girl picking flowers, and stands in rapt admiration
before it. Then he feels himself borne gently into the
painted wall, <i>à la</i> “Alice through the Looking-glass,”
and in the region beyond plays a part in a domestic
drama, finally marrying the heroine of the picture.
But the presence of a mortal being suspected by “a
man in golden armour with a face as black as jet,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
he was glad to make his way back again; and when
he rejoined a friend who had been waiting for him,
they noticed that the girl in the picture now wore her
hair done up as a married woman.</p>

<p>There is a sea-serpent story, and a story of a big bird

by his fellow-passengers to a small boat and cut

<p>The following is an extract from a story in which a
young student named Liu falls in love with a girl named
Fêng-hsien, who was the daughter of a fox, and therefore
possessed of the miraculous powers which the Chinese
associate with that animal:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘But if you would really like to have something that
has belonged to me,’ said she, ‘you shall.’ Whereupon
she took out a mirror and gave it to him, saying, ‘Whenever
you want to see me, you must look for me in your
books; otherwise I shall not be visible;’ and in a
moment she had vanished. Liu went home very melancholy
at heart; but when he looked in the mirror, there
was Fêng-hsien standing with her back to him, gazing,
as it were, at some one who was going away, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
a hundred paces from her. He then bethought himself
of her injunctions, and settled down to his studies, refusing
to receive any visitors; and a few days subsequently,
when he happened to look in the mirror, there was
Fêng-hsien, with her face turned towards him, and
smiling in every feature. After this, he was always
taking out the mirror to look at her. However, in about
a month his good resolutions began to disappear, and he
once more went out to enjoy himself and waste his time
as before. When he returned home and looked in the
mirror, Fêng-hsien seemed to be crying bitterly; and
the day after, when he looked at her again, she had her
back turned towards him as on the day he received the
mirror. He now knew that it was because he had
neglected his studies, and forthwith set to work again
with all diligence, until in a month’s time she had
turned round once again. Henceforward, whenever
anything interrupted his progress, Fêng-hsien’s countenance
became sad; but whenever he was getting on
well her sadness was changed to smiles. Night and
morning Liu would look at the mirror, regarding it quite
in the light of a revered preceptor, and in three years’
time he took his degree in triumph. ‘Now,’ cried he,
‘I shall be able to look Fêng-hsien in the face.’ And
there sure enough she was, with her delicately-pencilled
arched eyebrows, and her teeth just showing between
her lips, as happy-looking as she could be, when, all of a
sudden, she seemed to speak, and Liu heard her say, ‘A
pretty pair we make, I must allow,’ and the next moment
Fêng-hsien stood by his side.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is a story of the nether world, a favourite theme
with P’u Sung-ling. It illustrates the popular belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
at death a man’s soul is summoned to Purgatory by
spiritual lictors, who are even liable to make mistakes.
Cataleptic fits or trances give rise to many similar tales
about persons visiting the realms below and being afterwards
restored to life.</p>

<p>“A man named Chang died suddenly, and was escorted
at once by devil-lictors into the presence of the King of
Purgatory. His Majesty turned to Chang’s record of
good and evil, and then, in great anger, told the lictors
they had brought the wrong man, and bade them take
him back again. As they left the judgment-hall, Chang
persuaded his escort to let him have a look at Purgatory,
and accordingly the devils conducted him through the
nine sections, pointing out to him the Knife Hill, the
Sword Tree, and other objects of interest. By and by
they reached a place where there was a Buddhist priest
hanging suspended in the air, head downwards, by a
rope through a hole in his leg. He was shrieking with
pain and longing for death; and when Chang approached,
lo! he saw that it was his own brother. In great distress,
he asked his guides the reason of this punishment, and
they informed him that the priest was suffering thus
for collecting subscriptions on behalf of his order, and
then privately squandering the proceeds in gambling
and debauchery. ‘Nor,’ added they, ‘will he escape this
torment unless he repents him of his misdeeds.’ When
Chang came round, he thought his brother was already
dead, and hurried off to the Hsing-fu monastery, to
which the latter belonged. As he went in at the door
he heard a loud shrieking, and on proceeding to his
brother’s room, he found him laid up with a very bad
abscess in his leg, the leg itself being tied up above him
to the wall, this being, as his brother informed him, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
only bearable position in which he could lie. Chang
now told him what he had seen in Purgatory, at which
the priest was so terrified that he at once gave up taking
wine and meat, and devoted himself entirely to religious
exercises. In a fortnight he was well, and was known
ever afterwards as a most exemplary priest.”</p>

<p>Snatches of verse are to be found scattered about the
pages of these stories, enough to give a taste of the
writer’s quality without too much boring the reader.
These lines are much admired:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>But we have seen perhaps enough of P’u Sung-ling.
“If,” as Han Yü exclaimed, “there is knowledge after
death,” the profound and widespread esteem in which
this work is held by the literati of China must indeed
prove a soothing balm to the wounded spirit of the Last
of the Immortals.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE HUNG LOU MÊNG</div>

<p>The <cite>Hung Lou Mêng</cite>, conveniently but erroneously
known as “The Dream of the Red Chamber,” is the
work referred to already as touching the highest point
of development reached by the Chinese novel. It was
probably composed during the latter half of the seventeenth
century. The name of its author is unknown.
It is usually published in 24 vols. octavo, containing
120 chapters, which average at the least 30 pages each,
making a grand total of about 4000 pages. No fewer
than 400 personages of more or less importance are introduced
first and last into the story, the plot of which
is worked out with a completeness worthy of Fielding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
while the delineation of character&mdash;of so many characters&mdash;recalls
the best efforts of the greatest novelists of the
West. As a panorama of Chinese social life, in which
almost every imaginable feature is submitted in turn to
the reader, the <cite>Hung Lou Mêng</cite> is altogether without a
rival. Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an original and
effective love story, written for the most part in an easy,
almost colloquial, style, full of humorous and pathetic
episodes of everyday human life, and interspersed with
short poems of high literary finish. The opening
chapters, which are intended to form a link between the
world of spirits and the world of mortals, belong to the
supernatural; after that the story runs smoothly along
upon earthly lines, always, however, overshadowed by
the near presence of spiritual influences. Some idea of
the novel as a whole may perhaps be gathered from the
following abstract.</p>

<p>Four thousand six hundred and twenty-three years
ago the heavens were out of repair. So the Goddess of
Works set to and prepared 36,501 blocks of precious
jade, each 240 feet square by 120 feet in depth. Of
these, however, she only used 36,500, and cast aside the
single remaining block upon one of the celestial peaks.</p>

<p>This stone, under the process of preparation, had
become as it were spiritualised. It could expand or
contract. It could move. It was conscious of the
existence of an external world, and it was hurt at
not having been called upon to accomplish its divine
mission.</p>

<p>One day a Buddhist and a Taoist priest, who happened
to be passing that way, sat down for a while to rest, and
forthwith noticed the disconsolate stone which lay there,
no bigger than the pendant of a lady’s fan. “Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
my friend, you are not wanting in spirituality,” said the
Buddhist priest to the stone, as he picked it up and
laughingly held it forth upon the palm of his hand.
“But we cannot be certain that you will ever prove to
be of any real use; and, moreover, you lack an inscription,
without which your destiny must necessarily remain
unfulfilled.” Thereupon he put the stone in his sleeve
and rose to proceed on his journey.</p>

<p>“And what, if I may ask,” inquired his companion,
“do you intend to do with the stone you are thus
carrying away?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” replied the other, “to send it down to
earth, to play its allotted part in the fortunes of a certain
family now anxiously expecting its arrival. You see,
when the Goddess of Works rejected this stone, it used
to fill up its time by roaming about the heavens, until
chance brought it alongside of a lovely crimson flower.
Being struck with the great beauty of this flower, the
stone remained there for some time, tending its <i>protégée</i>
with the most loving care, and daily moistening its roots
with the choicest nectar of the sky, until at length,
yielding to the influence of disinterested love, the flower
changed its form and became a most beautiful girl.</p>

<p>“‘Dear stone,’ cried the girl, in her new-found ecstasy
of life, ‘the moisture thou hast bestowed upon me here
I will repay thee in our future state with my tears!’”</p>

<p>Ages afterwards, another priest, in search of light,
saw this self-same stone lying in its old place, but with a
record inscribed upon it&mdash;a record of how it had not
been used to repair the heavens, and how it subsequently
went down into the world of mortals, with a full description
of all it did, and saw, and heard while in that state.</p>

<p>“Brother Stone,” said the priest, “your record is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
one that deals with the deeds of heroes among men. It
does not stir us with stories either of virtuous statesmen
or of deathless patriots. It seems to be but a
simple tale of the loves of maidens and youths, hardly
important enough to attract the attention of the great
busy world.”</p>

<p>“Sir Priest,” replied the stone, “what you say is indeed
true; and what is more, my poor story is adorned
by no rhetorical flourish nor literary art. Still, the
world of mortals being what it is, and its complexion so
far determined by the play of human passion, I cannot
but think that the tale here inscribed may be of some
use, if only to throw a further charm around the banquet
hour, or to aid in dispelling those morning clouds which
gather over last night’s excess.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the priest looked once more at the stone,
and saw that it bore a plain unvarnished tale of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The downward slope to death,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>telling how a woman’s artless love had developed into
deep, destroying passion; and how from the thrall of a
lost love one soul had been raised to a sublimer, if not
a purer conception of man’s mission upon earth. He
therefore copied it out from beginning to end. Here
it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under a dynasty which the author leaves unnamed,
two brothers had greatly distinguished themselves by
efficient service to the State. In return, they had been
loaded with marks of Imperial favour. They had been
created nobles of the highest rank. They had amassed
wealth. The palaces assigned to them were near together
in Peking, and there their immediate descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
were enjoying the fruits of ancestral success when this
story opens. The brothers had each a son and heir;
but at the date at which we are now, fathers and sons
had all four passed away. The wife of one of the sons
only was still alive, a hale and hearty old lady of about
eighty years of age. Of her children, one was a daughter.
She had married and gone away south, and <em>her</em> daughter,
Tai-yü, is the heroine of this tale. The son of the
old lady’s second son and first cousin to Tai-yü is
the hero, living with his grandmother. His name is
Pao-yü.</p>

<p>The two noble families were now at the very zenith
of wealth and power. Their palatial establishments
were replete with every luxury. Feasting and theatricals
were the order of the day, and, to crown all, Pao-yü’s
sister had been chosen to be one of the seventy-two wives
allotted to the Emperor of China. No one stopped to
think that human events are governed by an inevitable
law of change. He who is mighty to-day shall be lowly to-morrow:
the rich shall be made poor, and the poor rich.
Or if any one, more thoughtful than the rest, did pause
awhile in knowledge of the appointments of Heaven, he
was fain to hope that the crash would not come, at any
rate, in his own day.</p>

<p>Things were in this state when Tai-yü’s mother died,
and her father decided to place his motherless daughter
under the care of her grandmother at Peking. Accompanied
by her governess, the young lady set out at once
for the capital, and reached her destination in safety. It
is not necessary to dwell upon her beauty nor upon her
genius, though both are minutely described in the original
text. Suffice it to say that during the years which have
elapsed since she first became known to the public, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
brave men are said to have died for love of this entrancing
heroine of fiction.</p>

<p>Tai-yü was received most kindly by all. Especially so
by her grandmother, who shed bitter tears of sorrow over
the premature death of Tai-yü’s mother, her lost and
favourite child. She was introduced to her aunts and
cousins, and cousins and aunts, in such numbers that
the poor girl must have wondered how ever she should
remember all their names. Then they sat down and
talked. They asked her all about her mother, and how
she fell ill, and what medicine she took, and how she
died and was buried, until the old grandmother wept
again. “And what medicine do you take, my dear?”
asked the old lady, seeing that Tai-yü herself seemed
very delicate, and carried on her clear cheek a suspicious-looking
flush.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have done nothing ever since I could eat,”
replied Tai-yü, “but take medicine of some kind or
other. I have also seen all the best doctors, but they
have not done me any particular good. When I was
only three years of age, a nasty old priest came and
wanted my parents to let me be a nun. He said it was
the only way to save me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will soon cure you here,” said her grandmother,
smiling. “We will make you well in no time.”</p>

<p>Tai-yü was then taken to see more of her relatives,
including her aunt, the mother of Pao-yü, who warned
her against his peculiar temper, which she said was very
uncertain and variable. “What! the one with the
jade?” asked Tai-yü. “But we shall not be together,”
she immediately added, somewhat surprised at this
rather unusual warning. “Oh yes, you will,” said her
aunt. “He is dreadfully spoilt by his grandmother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
allows him to have his own way in everything. Instead
of being hard at work, as he ought to be by now, he
idles away his time with the girls, thinking only how he
can enjoy himself, without any idea of making a career
or adding fresh lustre to the family name. Beware of
him, I tell you.”</p>

<p>The dinner-hour had now arrived, and after the meal
Tai-yü was questioned as to the progress she had made
in her studies. She was already deep in the mysteries
of the Four Books, and it was agreed on all sides that
she was far ahead of her cousins, when suddenly a
noise was heard outside, and in came a most elegantly
dressed youth about a year older than Tai-yü, wearing a
cap lavishly adorned with pearls. His face was like
the full autumn moon. His complexion like morning
flowers in spring. Pencilled eyebrows, a well-cut
shapely nose, and eyes like rippling waves were among
the details which went to make up an unquestionably
handsome exterior. Around his neck hung a curious
piece of jade; and as soon as Tai-yü became fully
conscious of his presence, a thrill passed through her
delicate frame. She felt that somewhere or other she
had looked upon that face before.</p>

<p>Pao-yü&mdash;for it was he&mdash;saluted his grandmother with
great respect, and then went off to see his mother; and
while he is absent it may be as well to say a few words
about the young gentleman’s early days.</p>

<p>Pao-yü, a name which means Precious Jade, was so
called because he was born, to the great astonishment of
everybody, with a small tablet of jade in his mouth&mdash;a
beautifully bright mirror-like tablet, bearing a legend
inscribed in the quaint old style of several thousand
years ago. A family consultation resulted in a decision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that this stone was some divine talisman, the purpose of
which was not for the moment clear, but was doubtless
to be revealed by and by. One thing was certain. As
this tablet had come into the world with the child, so it
should accompany him through life; and accordingly
Pao-yü was accustomed to wear it suspended around his
neck. The news of this singular phenomenon spread far
and wide. Even Tai-yü had heard of it long before she
came to take up her abode with the family.</p>

<p>And so Pao-yü grew up, a wilful, wayward boy. He
was a bright, clever fellow and full of fun, but very
averse to books. He declared, in fact, that he could not
read at all unless he had as fellow-students a young lady
on each side of him, to keep his brain clear! And
when his father beat him, as was frequently the case, he
would cry out, “Dear girl! dear girl!” all the time, in
order, as he afterwards explained to his cousins, to take
away the pain. Women, he argued, are made of water,
with pellucid mobile minds, while men are mostly made
of mud, mere lumps of uninformed clay.</p>

<p>By this time he had returned from seeing his mother
and was formally introduced to Tai-yü. “Ha!” cried
he, “I have seen her before somewhere. What makes
her eyes so red? Indeed, cousin Tai-yü, we shall have
to call you Cry-baby if you cry so much.” Here some
reference was made to his jade tablet, and this put him
into an angry mood at once. None of his cousins had
any, he said, and he was not going to wear his any more.
A family scene ensued, during which Tai-yü went off to
bed and cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Pao-yü’s mother’s sister was compelled
by circumstances to seek a residence in the
capital. She brought with her a daughter, Pao-ch’ai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
another cousin to Pao-yü, but about a year older than
he was; and besides receiving a warm welcome, the
two were invited to settle themselves comfortably down
in the capacious family mansion of their relatives. Thus
it was that destiny brought Pao-yü and his two cousins
together under the same roof.</p>

<p>The three soon became fast friends. Pao-ch’ai had
been carefully educated by her father, and was able to
hold her own even against the accomplished Tai-yü.
Pao-yü loved the society of either or both. He was
always happy so long as he had a pretty girl by his side,
and was, moreover, fascinated by the wit of these two
young ladies in particular.</p>

<p>He had, however, occasional fits of moody depression,
varied by discontent with his superfluous worldly surroundings.
“In what am I better,” he would say, “than
a wallowing hog? Why was I born and bred amid this
splendid magnificence of wealth, instead of in some
coldly furnished household where I could have enjoyed
the pure communion of friends? These silks and satins,
these rich meats and choice wines, of what avail are
they to this perishable body of mine? O wealth! O
power! I curse you both, ye cankerworms of my
earthly career.”</p>

<p>All these morbid thoughts, however, were speedily
dispelled by the presence of his fair cousins, with whom,
in fact, Pao-yü spent most of the time he ought to have
devoted to his books. He was always running across to
see either one or other of these young ladies, or meeting
both of them in general assembly at his grandmother’s.
It was at a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Pao-ch’ai that she made him
show her his marvellous piece of jade, with the inscription,
which she read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lose me not, forget me not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal life shall be thy lot.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The indiscretion of a slave-girl here let Pao-yü become
aware that Pao-ch’ai herself possessed a wonderful gold
amulet, upon which also were certain words inscribed;
and of course Pao-yü insisted on seeing it at once. On
it was written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Let not this token wander from thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And youth perennial shall with thee abide.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the middle of this interesting scene, Tai-yü walks
in, and seeing how intimately the two are engaged,
“hopes she doesn’t intrude.” But even in those early
days the ring of her voice betrayed symptoms of that
jealousy to which later on she succumbed. Meanwhile
she almost monopolises the society of Pao-yü, and he,
on his side, finds himself daily more and more attracted
by the sprightly mischievous humour of the beautiful
Tai-yü, as compared with the quieter and more orthodox
loveliness of Pao-ch’ai. Pao-ch’ai does not know what
jealousy means. She too loves to bandy words, exchange
verses, or puzzle over conundrums with her
mercurial cousin; but she never allows her thoughts to
wander towards him otherwise than is consistent with
the strictest maidenly reserve.</p>

<p>Not so Tai-yü. She had been already for some time
Pao-yü’s chief companion when they were joined by
Pao-ch’ai. She had come to regard the handsome boy
almost as a part of herself, though not conscious of the
fact until called upon to share his society with another.
And so it was that although Pao-yü showed an open
preference for herself, she still grudged the lesser attentions
he paid to Pao-ch’ai. As often as not these same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
attentions originated in an irresistible impulse to tease.
Pao-yü and Tai-yü were already lovers in so far that
they were always quarrelling; the more so, that their
quarrels invariably ended, as they should end, in the
renewal of love. As a rule, Tai-yü fell back upon the
<i>ultima ratio</i> of all women&mdash;tears; and of course Pao-yü,
who was not by any means wanting in chivalry, had no
alternative but to wipe them away. On one particular
occasion, Tai-yü declared that she would die; upon
which Pao-yü said that in that case he would become a
monk and devote his life to Buddha; but in this instance
it was he who shed the tears and she who had to wipe
them away.</p>

<p>All this time Tai-yü and Pao-ch’ai were on terms of
scrupulous courtesy. Tai-yü’s father had recently died,
and her fortunes now seemed to be bound up more
closely than ever with those of the family in which she
lived. She had a handsome gold ornament given her to
match Pao-ch’ai’s amulet, and the three young people
spent their days together, thinking only how to get most
enjoyment out of every passing hour. Sometimes, however,
a shade of serious thought would darken Tai-yü’s
moments of enforced solitude; and one day Pao-yü
surprised her in a secluded part of the garden, engaged
in burying flowers which had been blown down by the
wind, while singing the following lines:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Pao-yü’s father had received an appointment
which took him away to a distance, the consequence
being that life went on at home in a giddier round than
usual. Nothing the old grandmother liked better than a
picnic or a banquet&mdash;feasting, in fact, of some kind, with
plenty of wine and mirth. But now, somehow or other,
little things were always going wrong. In every pot of
ointment the traditional fly was sure to make its appearance;
in every sparkling goblet a bitter something would
always bubble up. Money was not so plentiful as it had
been, and there seemed to be always occurring some unforeseen
drain upon the family resources. Various members
of one or other of the two grand establishments get
into serious trouble with the authorities. Murder, suicide,
and robbery happen upon the premises. The climax of
prosperity had been reached and the hour of decadence
had arrived. Still all went merry as a marriage-bell,
and Pao-yü and Tai-yü continued the agreeable pastime
of love-making. In this they were further favoured by
circumstances. Pao-ch’ai’s mother gave up the apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>ments
which had been assigned to her, and went to live
in lodgings in the city, of course taking Pao-ch’ai with
her. Some time previous to this, a slave-girl had casually
remarked to Pao-yü that her young mistress, Tai-yü, was
about to leave and go back again to the south. Pao-yü
fainted on the spot, and was straightway carried off and
put to bed. He bore the departure of Pao-ch’ai with
composure. He could not even hear of separation from
his beloved Tai-yü.</p>

<p>And she was already deeply in love with him. Long,
long ago her faithful slave-girl had whispered into her
ear the soft possibility of union with her cousin. Day
and night she thought about Pao-yü, and bitterly regretted
that she had now neither father nor mother on
whom she could rely to effect the object that lay nearest
to her heart. One evening, tired out under the ravages
of the great passion, she flung herself down, without
undressing, upon a couch to sleep. But she had hardly
closed her eyes ere her grandmother and a whole bevy
of aunts and cousins walked in to offer, as they said,
their hearty congratulations. Tai-yü was astonished,
and asked what on earth their congratulations meant;
upon which it was explained to her that her father had
married again, and that her stepmother had arranged
for her a most eligible match, in consequence of which
she was to leave for home immediately. With floods
of tears Tai-yü entreated her grandmother not to
send her away. She did not want to marry, and she
would rather become a slave-girl at her grandmother’s
feet than fall in with the scheme proposed. She exhausted
every argument, and even invoked the spirit
of her dead mother to plead her cause; but the old
lady was obdurate, and finally went away, saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the arrangement would have to be carried out. Then
Tai-yü saw no escape but the one last resource of all;
when at that moment Pao-yü entered, and with a smile
on his face began to offer her <em>his</em> congratulations too.</p>

<p>“Thank you, cousin,” cried she, starting up and
seizing him rudely by the arm. “Now I know you for
the false, fickle creature you are!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, dear girl?” inquired Pao-yü
in amazement. “I was only glad for your sake that you
had found a lover at last.”</p>

<p>“And what lover do you think I could ever care to
find now?” rejoined Tai-yü.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Pao-yü, “I should of course wish it to
be myself. I consider you indeed mine already; and
if you think of the way I have always behaved towards
you ...”</p>

<p>“What!” said Tai-yü, partly misunderstanding his
words, “can it be you after all? and do you really wish
me to remain with you?”</p>

<p>“You shall see with your own eyes,” answered Pao-yü,
“even into the inmost recesses of my heart, and then
perhaps you will believe.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he drew a knife, and plunging it into his
body, ripped himself open so as to expose his heart to
view. With a shriek Tai-yü tried to stay his hand, and
felt herself drenched with the flow of fresh warm blood;
when suddenly Pao-yü uttered a loud groan, and crying
out, “Great heaven, my heart is gone!” fell senseless
to the ground. “Help! help!” screamed Tai-yü; “he
is dying! he is dying!” “Wake up! wake up!” said
Tai-yü’s maid; “whatever has given you nightmare like
this?”</p>

<p>So Tai-yü waked up and found that she had had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
bad dream. But she had something worse than that.
She had a bad illness to follow; and strange to say,
Pao-yü was laid up at the same time. The doctor came
and felt her pulse&mdash;both pulses, in fact&mdash;and shook his
head, and drank a cup of tea, and said that Tai-yü’s vital
principle wanted nourishment, which it would get out
of a prescription he then and there wrote down. As to
Pao-yü, he was simply suffering from a fit of temporary
indigestion.</p>

<p>So Tai-yü got better, and Pao-yü recovered his spirits.
His father had returned home, and he was once more
obliged to make some show of work, and consequently
had fewer hours to spend in the society of his cousin.
He was now a young man, and the question of his
marriage began to occupy a foremost place in the minds
of his parents and grandmother. Several names were
proposed, one especially by his father; but it was finally
agreed that it was unnecessary to go far afield to secure
a fitting bride. It was merely a choice between the two
charming young ladies who had already shared so much
in his daily life. But the difficulty lay precisely there.
Where each was perfection it became invidious to choose.
In another famous Chinese novel, already described, a
similar difficulty is got over in this way&mdash;the hero marries
both. Here, however, the family elders were distracted
by rival claims. By their gentle, winning manners,
Pao-ch’ai and Tai-yü had made themselves equally beloved
by all the inmates of these two noble houses,
from the venerable grandmother down to the meanest
slave-girl. Their beauty was of different styles, but at
the bar of man’s opinion each would probably have
gained an equal number of votes. Tai-yü was undoubtedly
the cleverer of the two, but Pao-ch’ai had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
better health; and in the judgment of those with whom
the decision rested, health carried the day. It was
arranged that Pao-yü was to marry Pao-ch’ai.</p>

<p>This momentous arrangement was naturally made in
secret. Various preliminaries would have to be gone
through before a verbal promise could give place to
formal betrothal. And it is a well-ascertained fact that
secrets can only be kept by men, while this one was
confided to at least a dozen women. Consequently,
one night when Tai-yü was ill and alone in her room,
yearning for the love that had already been contracted
away to another, she heard two slave-girls outside
whispering confidences, and fancied she caught Pao-yü’s
name. She listened again, and this time without
doubt, for she heard them say that Pao-yü was engaged
to marry a lady of good family and many accomplishments.
Just then a parrot called out, “Here’s your
mistress: pour out the tea!” which frightened the slave-girls
horribly; and they forthwith separated, one of
them running inside to attend upon Tai-yü herself.
She finds her young mistress in a very agitated state,
but Tai-yü is always ailing now.</p>

<p>This time she was seriously ill. She ate nothing.
She was racked by a dreadful cough. Even a Chinese
doctor could now hardly fail to see that she was far
advanced in a decline. But none knew that the sickness
of her body had originated in sickness of the heart.</p>

<p>One night she grew rapidly worse and worse, and lay
to all appearances dying. A slave-girl ran to summon
her grandmother, while several others remained in the
room talking about Pao-yü and his intended marriage.
“It was all off,” said one of them. “His grandmother
would not agree to the young lady chosen by his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
She had already made her own choice&mdash;of another
young lady who lives in the family, and of whom we
are all very fond.” The dying girl heard these words,
and it then flashed across her that after all she must
herself be the bride intended for Pao-yü. “For if not
I,” argued she, “who can it possibly be?” Thereupon
she rallied as it were by a supreme effort of will, and, to
the great astonishment of all, called for a drink of tea.
Those who had come expecting to see her die were now
glad to think that her youth might ultimately prevail.</p>

<p>So Tai-yü got better once more; but only better, not
well. For the sickness of the soul is not to be cured
by drugs. Meanwhile, an event occurred which for the
time being threw everything else into the shade. <em>Pao-yü
lost his jade tablet.</em> After changing his clothes, he
had forgotten to put it on, and had left it lying upon his
table. But when he sent to fetch it, it was gone. A
search was instituted high and low, without success.
The precious talisman was missing. No one dared tell
his grandmother and face the old lady’s wrath. As to
Pao-yü himself, he treated the matter lightly. Gradually,
however, a change came over his demeanour. He
was often absent-minded. At other times his tongue
would run away with him, and he talked nonsense. At
length he got so bad that it became imperative to do
something. So his grandmother had to be told. Of
course she was dreadfully upset, but she made a move
in the right direction, and offered an enormous reward
for its recovery. The result was that within a few days
the reward was claimed. But in the interval the tablet
seemed to have lost much of its striking brilliancy; and
a closer inspection showed it to be in reality nothing
more than a clever imitation. This was a crushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
disappointment to all. Pao-yü’s illness was increasing
day by day. His father had received another appointment
in the provinces, and it was eminently desirable
that Pao-yü’s marriage should take place previous to his
departure. The great objection to hurrying on the
ceremony was that the family were in mourning.
Among other calamities which had befallen of late, the
young lady in the palace had died, and her influence at
Court was gone. Still, everything considered, it was
deemed advisable to solemnise the wedding without
delay. Pao-yü’s father, little as he cared for the character
of his only son, had been greatly shocked at the
change which he now saw. A worn, haggard face, with
sunken, lack-lustre eyes; rambling, inconsequent talk&mdash;this
was the heir in whom the family hopes were centred.
The old grandmother, finding that doctors were of little
avail, had even called in a fortune-teller, who said pretty
much what he was wanted to say, viz., that Pao-yü
should marry some one with a golden destiny to help
him on.</p>

<p>So the chief actors in the tragedy about to be enacted
had to be consulted at last. They began with Pao-ch’ai,
for various reasons; and she, like a modest, well-bred
maiden, received her mother’s commands in submissive
silence. Further, from that day she ceased to mention
Pao-yü’s name. With Pao-yü, however, it was a different
thing altogether. His love for Tai-yü was a matter
of some notoriety, especially with the slave-girls, one of
whom even went so far as to tell his mother that his
heart was set upon marrying her whom the family had
felt obliged to reject. It was therefore hardly doubtful
how he would receive the news of his betrothal to
Pao-ch’ai; and as in his present state of health the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
consequences could not be ignored, it was resolved to
have recourse to stratagem. So the altar was prepared,
and naught remained but to draw the bright death across
the victim’s throat.</p>

<p>In the short time which intervened, the news was
broken to Tai-yü in an exceptionally cruel manner.
She heard by accident in conversation with a slave-girl
in the garden that Pao-yü was to marry Pao-ch’ai. The
poor girl felt as if a thunderbolt had pierced her brain.
Her whole frame quivered beneath the shock. She
turned to go back to her room, but half unconsciously
followed the path that led to Pao-yü’s apartments.
Hardly noticing the servants in attendance, she almost
forced her way in, and stood in the presence of her
cousin. He was sitting down, and he looked up and
laughed a foolish laugh when he saw her enter; but
he did not rise, and he did not invite her to be seated.
Tai-yü sat down without being asked, and without a
word spoken on either side. And the two sat there, and
stared and leered at each other, until they both broke
out into wild delirious laughter, the senseless crazy
laughter of the madhouse. “What makes you ill,
cousin?” asked Tai-yü, when the first burst of their
dreadful merriment had subsided. “I am in love with
Tai-yü,” he replied; and then they both went off into
louder screams of laughter than before.</p>

<p>At this point the slave-girls thought it high time to
interfere, and, after much more laughing and nodding of
heads, Tai-yü was persuaded to go away. She set off to
run back to her own room, and sped along with a newly
acquired strength. But just as she was nearing the door,
she was seen to fall, and the terrified slave-girl who rushed
to pick her up found her with her mouth full of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time all formalities have been gone through
and the wedding day is fixed. It is not to be a grand
wedding, but of course there must be a trousseau. Pao-ch’ai
sometimes weeps, she scarcely knows why; but
preparations for the great event of her life leave her,
fortunately, very little leisure for reflection. Tai-yü is
in bed, and, but for a faithful slave-girl, alone. Nobody
thinks much about her at this juncture; when the wedding
is over she is to receive a double share of attention.</p>

<p>One morning she makes the slave-girl bring her all her
poems and various other relics of the happy days gone
by. She turns them over and over between her thin and
wasted fingers until finally she commits them all to the
flames. The effort is too much for her, and the slave-girl
in despair hurries across to the grandmother’s for
assistance. She finds the whole place deserted, but a
moment’s thought reminds her that the old lady is
doubtless with Pao-yü. So thither she makes her way
as fast as her feet can carry her, only, however, to be still
further amazed at finding the rooms shut up, and no one
there. Utterly confused, and not knowing what to make
of these unlooked-for circumstances, she is about to run
back to Tai-yü’s room, when to her great relief she espies
a fellow-servant in the distance, who straightway informs
her that it is Pao-yü’s wedding-day, and that he had
moved into another suite of apartments. And so it was.
Pao-yü had joyfully agreed to the proposition that he
should marry his cousin, for he had been skilfully given
to understand that the cousin in question was Tai-yü.
And now the much wished-for hour had arrived. The
veiled bride, accompanied by the very slave-girl who had
long ago escorted her from the south, alighted from her
sedan-chair at Pao-yü’s door. The wedding march was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
played, and the young couple proceeded to the final
ceremony of worship, which made them irrevocably
man and wife. Then, as is customary upon such occasions,
Pao-yü raised his bride’s veil. For a moment he
seemed as though suddenly turned into stone, as he
stood there speechless and motionless, with fixed eyes
gazing upon a face he had little expected to behold.
Meanwhile, Pao-ch’ai retired into an inner apartment;
and then, for the first time, Pao-yü found his voice.</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming?” cried he, looking round upon his
assembled relatives and friends.</p>

<p>“No, you are married,” replied several of those nearest
to him. “Take care; your father is outside. He arranged
it all.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” said Pao-yü, with averted head,
pointing in the direction of the door through which
Pao-ch’ai had disappeared.</p>

<p>“It was Pao-ch’ai, your wife...”</p>

<p>“Tai-yü, you mean; Tai-yü is my wife,” shrieked he,
interrupting them; “I want Tai-yü! I want Tai-yü! Oh,
bring us together, and save us both!” Here he broke
down altogether. Thick sobs choked his further utterance,
until relief came in a surging flood of tears.</p>

<p>All this time Tai-yü was dying, dying beyond hope of
recall. She knew that the hour of release was at hand,
and she lay there quietly waiting for death. Every now
and again she swallowed a teaspoonful of broth, but
gradually the light faded out of her eyes, and the slave-girl,
faithful to the last, felt that her young mistress’s
fingers were rapidly growing cold. At that moment,
Tai-yü’s lips were seen to move, and she was distinctly
heard to say, “O Pao-yü, Pao-yü...” Those words
were her last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then, breaking in upon the hushed moments
which succeed dissolution, sounds of far-off music were
borne along upon the breeze. The slave-girl crept
stealthily to the door, and strained her ear to listen; but
she could hear nothing save the soughing of the wind as
it moaned fitfully through the trees.</p>

<p>But the bridegroom himself had already entered the
valley of the dark shadow. Pao-yü was very ill. He
raved and raved about Tai-yü, until at length Pao-ch’ai,
who had heard the news, took upon herself the painful
task of telling him she was already dead. “Dead?”
cried Pao-yü, “dead?” and with a loud groan he fell
back upon the bed insensible. A darkness came before
his eyes, and he seemed to be transported into a region
which was unfamiliar to him. Looking about, he saw
some one advancing towards him, and immediately
called out to the stranger to be kind enough to tell him
where he was. “You are on the road to the next world,”
replied the man; “but your span of life is not yet complete,
and you have no business here.” Pao-yü explained
that he had come in search of Tai-yü, who had
lately died; to which the man replied that Tai-yü’s soul
had already gone back to its home in the pure serene.
“And if you would see her again,” added the man,
“return to your duties upon earth. Fulfil your destiny
there, chasten your understanding, nourish the divinity
that is within you, and you may yet hope to meet her
once more.” The man then flung a stone at him and
struck him over the heart, which so frightened Pao-yü
that he turned to retrace his steps. At that moment he
heard himself loudly called by name; and opening his
eyes, saw his mother and grandmother standing by the
side of his bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>They had thought that he was gone, and were overjoyed
at seeing him return to life, even though it was
the same life as before, clouded with the great sorrow of
unreason. For now they could always hope; and when
they saw him daily grow stronger and stronger in bodily
health, it seemed that ere long even his mental equilibrium
might be restored. The more so that he had
ceased to mention Tai-yü’s name, and treated Pao-ch’ai
with marked kindness and respect.</p>

<p>All this time the fortunes of the two grand families are
sinking from bad to worse. Pao-yü’s uncle is mixed up
in an act of disgraceful oppression; while his father,
at his new post, makes the foolish endeavour to be an
honest incorrupt official. He tries to put his foot down
upon the system of bribery which prevails, but succeeds
only in getting himself recalled and impeached for maladministration
of affairs. The upshot of all this is that
an Imperial decree is issued confiscating the property and
depriving the families of their hereditary rank. Besides
this, the lineal representatives are to be banished; and
within the walls which have been so long sacred to mirth
and merrymaking, consternation now reigns supreme.
“O high Heaven,” cries Pao-yü’s father, as his brother
and nephew start for their place of banishment, “that
the fortunes of our family should fall like this!”</p>

<p>Of all, perhaps the old grandmother felt the blow
most severely. She had lived for eighty-three years in
affluence, accustomed to the devotion of her children
and the adulation of friends. But now money was
scarce, and the voice of flattery unheard. The courtiers
of prosperous days forgot to call, and even the servants
deserted at their posts. And so it came about that the
old lady fell ill, and within a few days was lying upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
her death-bed. She spoke a kind word to all, except to
Pao-ch’ai. For her she had only a sigh, that fate had
linked her with a husband whose heart was buried in the
grave. So she died, and there was a splendid funeral,
paid for out of funds raised at the pawnshop. Pao-ch’ai
appeared in white; and among the flowers which
were gathered around the bier, she was unanimously
pronounced to be the fairest blossom of all.</p>

<p>Then other members of the family die, and Pao-yü
relapses into a condition as critical as ever. He is in
fact at the point of death, when a startling announcement
restores him again to consciousness. A Buddhist
priest is at the outer gate, and he has brought back
Pao-yü’s lost tablet of jade. There was, of course, great
excitement on all sides; but the priest refused to part
with the jade until he had got the promised reward.
And where now was it possible to raise such a sum as
that, and at a moment’s notice? Still it was felt that
the tablet must be recovered at all costs. Pao-yü’s life
depended on it, and he was the sole hope of the family.
So the priest was promised his reward, and the jade
was conveyed into the sick-room. But when Pao-yü
clutched it in his eager hand, he dropped it with a loud
cry and fell back gasping upon the bed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Pao-yü’s breathing became more and
more distressed, and a servant ran out to call in the
priest, in the hope that something might yet be done. The
priest, however, had disappeared, and by this time Pao-yü
had ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the disunion of body and soul
which mortals call death, the spirit of Pao-yü set off
on its journey to the Infinite, led by a Buddhist priest.
Just then a voice called out and said that Tai-yü was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
awaiting him, and at that moment many familiar faces
crowded round him, but as he gazed at them in recognition,
they changed into grinning goblins. At length he
reached a spot where there was a beautiful crimson
flower in an enclosure, so carefully tended that neither
bees nor butterflies were allowed to settle upon it. It
was a flower, he was told, which had been to fulfil a
mission upon earth, and had recently returned to the
Infinite. He was now taken to see Tai-yü. A bamboo
screen which hung before the entrance to a room was
raised, and there before him stood his heart’s idol, his
lost Tai-yü. Stretching forth his hands, he was about
to speak to her, when suddenly the screen was hastily
dropped. The priest gave him a shove, and he fell
backwards, awaking as though from a dream.</p>

<p>Once more he had regained a new hold upon life;
once more he had emerged from the very jaws of death.
This time he was a changed man. He devoted himself
to reading for the great public examination, in the hope
of securing the much coveted degree of Master of Arts.
Nevertheless, he talks little, and seems to care less, about
the honours and glory of this world; and what is stranger
than all, he appears to have very much lost his taste for
the once fascinating society of women. For a time he
seems to be under the spell of a religious craze, and is
always arguing with Pao-ch’ai upon the advantages of
devoting one’s life to the service of Buddha. But shortly
before the examination he burned all the books he had
collected which treated of immortality and a future state,
and concentrated every thought upon the great object
before him.</p>

<p>At length the day comes, and Pao-yü, accompanied by
a nephew who is also a candidate, prepares to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
arena. His father was away from home. He had gone
southwards to take the remains of the grandmother and of
Tai-yü back to their ancestral burying-ground. So Pao-yü
first goes to take leave of his mother, and she addresses
to him a few parting words, full of encouragement and
hope. Then Pao-yü falls upon his knees, and implores
her pardon for all the trouble he has caused her. “I can
only trust,” he added, “that I shall now be successful,
and that you, dear mother, will be happy.” And then
amid tears and good wishes, the two young men set out for
the examination-hall, where, with several thousand other
candidates, they are to remain for some time immured.</p>

<p>The hours and days speed apace, full of arduous effort
to those within, of anxiety to those without. At last the
great gates are thrown wide open, and the vast crowd
of worn-out, weary students bursts forth, to meet the
equally vast crowd of eager, expectant friends. In the
crush that ensues, Pao-yü and his nephew lose sight of
each other, and the nephew reaches home first. There
the feast of welcome is already spread, and the wine-kettles
are put to the fire. So every now and again somebody
runs out to see if Pao-yü is not yet in sight. But the
time passes and he comes not. Fears as to his personal
safety begin to be aroused, and messengers are sent out
in all directions. Pao-yü is nowhere to be found. The
night comes and goes. The next day and the next day,
and still no Pao-yü. He has disappeared without leaving
behind him the faintest clue to his whereabouts. Meanwhile,
the list of successful candidates is published, and
Pao-yü’s name stands seventh on the list. His nephew
has the 130th place. What a triumph for the family,
and what rapture would have been theirs, but for the
mysterious absence of Pao-yü.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus their joy was shaded by sorrow, until hope,
springing eternal, was unexpectedly revived. Pao-yü’s
winning essay had attracted the attention of the Emperor,
and his Majesty issued an order for the writer to appear
at Court. An Imperial order may not be lightly disregarded;
and it was fervently hoped by the family that
by these means Pao-yü might be restored to them.
This, in fact, was all that was wanting now to secure the
renewed prosperity of the two ancient houses. The tide
of events had set favourably at last. Those who had
been banished to the frontier had greatly distinguished
themselves against the banditti who ravaged the country
round about. There was Pao-yü’s success and his
nephew’s; and above all, the gracious clemency of the
Son of Heaven. Free pardons were granted, confiscated
estates were returned. The two families basked again
in the glow of Imperial favour. Pao-ch’ai was about to
become a mother; the ancestral line might be continued
after all. But Pao-yü, where was he? That remained a
mystery still, against which even the Emperor’s mandate
proved to be of no avail.</p>

<p>It was on his return journey that Pao-yü’s father heard
of the success and disappearance of his son. Torn by
conflicting emotions he hurried on, in his haste to reach
home and aid in unravelling the secret of Pao-yü’s hiding-place.
One moonlight night, his boat lay anchored
alongside the shore, which a storm of the previous day
had wrapped in a mantle of snow. He was sitting
writing at a table, when suddenly, through the half-open
door, advancing towards him over the bow of the boat,
his silhouette sharply defined against the surrounding
snow, he saw the figure of a shaven-headed Buddhist
priest. The priest knelt down, and struck his head four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
times upon the ground, and then, without a word, turned
back to join two other priests who were awaiting him.
The three vanished as imperceptibly as they had come;
before, indeed, the astonished father was able to realise
that he had been, for the last time, face to face with
Pao-yü!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

THE EMPERORS K’ANG HSI AND CH’IEN LUNG</h3>


<p>The second Emperor of the Manchu dynasty, known to
the world by his year-title <span class="smcap">K’ang Hsi</span>, succeeded to the
throne in 1662 when he was only eight years of age, and
six years later he took up the reins of government. Fairly
tall and well-proportioned, he loved all manly exercises
and devoted three months annually to hunting. Large
bright eyes lighted up his face, which was pitted with
small-pox. Contemporary observers vie in praising his
wit, understanding, and liberality of mind. Indefatigable
in government, he kept a careful watch on his Ministers,
his love for the people leading him to prefer economy
to taxation. He was personally frugal, yet on public
works he would lavish large sums. He patronised the
Jesuits, whom he employed in surveying the empire, in
astronomy, and in casting cannon; though latterly he
found it necessary to impose restrictions on their propagandism.
In spite of war and rebellion, which must
have encroached seriously upon his time, he found leisure
to initiate and carry out, with the aid of the leading
scholars of the day, several of the greatest literary enterprises
the world has ever seen. The chief of these are
(1) the <cite>K’ang Hsi Tzŭ Tien</cite>, the great standard dictionary
of the Chinese language; (2) the <cite>P’ei Wên Yün Fu</cite>, a
huge concordance to all literature, bound up in forty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>four
large closely-printed volumes; (3) the <cite>P’ien Tzŭ Lei
P’ien</cite>, a similar work, with a different arrangement, bound
up in thirty-six large volumes; (4) the <cite>Yüan Chien Lei
Han</cite>, an encyclopædia, bound up in forty-four volumes;
and (5) the <cite>T’u Shu Chi Ch’êng</cite>, a profusely illustrated
encyclopædia, in 1628 volumes of about 200 pages to each.
To the above must be added a considerable collection of
literary remains, in prose and verse, which, of course,
were actually the Emperor’s own work. It cannot be
said that any of these remains are of a high order, or are
familiar to the public at large, with a single and trifling
exception. The so-called Sacred Edict is known from
one end of China to the other. It originally consisted of
sixteen moral maxims delivered in 1670 under the form
of an edict by the Emperor K’ang Hsi. His Majesty
himself had just reached the mature age of sixteen. He
had then probably discovered that men’s morals were
no longer what they had been in the days of “ancient
kings,” and with boyish earnestness he made a kindly
effort to do something for the people whose welfare was
destined to be for so many years to come his chief and
most absorbing care. The maxims are commonplace
enough, but for the sake of the great Emperor who
loved his “children” more than himself they have been
exalted into utterances almost divine. Here are the first,
seventh, and eleventh maxims, as specimens:</p>

<p>“Pay great attention to filial piety and to brotherly
obedience, in order to give due weight to human
relationships.”</p>

<p>“Discard strange doctrines, in order to glorify the
orthodox teaching.”</p>

<p>“Educate your sons and younger brothers, in order
to hinder them from doing what is wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>K’ang Hsi died in 1722, after completing a full cycle
of sixty years as occupant of the Dragon Throne. His
son and successor, Yung Chêng, caused one hundred
picked scholars to submit essays enlarging upon the
maxims of his father, and of these the sixteen best were
chosen, and in 1724 it was enacted that they should be
publicly read to the people on the 1st and 15th of each
month in every city and town in the empire. This law
is still in force. Subsequently, the sixteen essays were
paraphrased into easy colloquial; and now the maxims,
the essays, and the paraphrase, together make up a
volume which may be roughly said to contain the whole
duty of man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CH’IEN LUNG</div>

<p>In 1735 the Emperor Yung Chêng died, and was
succeeded by his fourth son, who reigned as <span class="smcap">Ch’ien
Lung</span>. An able ruler, with an insatiable thirst for
knowledge, and an indefatigable administrator, he rivals
his grandfather’s fame as a sovereign and a patron of
letters. New editions of important historical works and
of encyclopædias were issued by Imperial order, and
under the superintendence of the Emperor himself. In
1772 there was a general search for all literary works
worthy of preservation, and ten years later a voluminous
collection of these was published, embracing many rare
books taken from the great encyclopædia of the
Emperor Yung Lo. A descriptive catalogue of the
Imperial Library, containing 3460 works arranged under
the four heads of Classics, History, Philosophy, and
General Literature, was drawn up in 1772-1790. It
gives the history of each work, which is also criticised.
The vastness of this catalogue led to the publication
of an abridgment, which omits all works not actually
preserved in the Library. The personal writings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
this Emperor are very voluminous. They consist of a
general collection containing a variety of notes on current
or ancient topics, prefaces to books, and the like,
and also of a collection of poems. Of these last, those
produced between 1736 and 1783 were published, and
reached the almost incredible total of 33,950 separate
pieces. It need hardly be added that nearly all are very
short. Even thus the output must be considered a
record, apart from the fact that during the reign there
was a plentiful supply both of war and rebellion.
Burmah and Nepaul were forced to pay tribute;
Chinese supremacy was established in Tibet; and
Kuldja and Kashgaria were added to the empire. In
1795, on completing a cycle of sixty years of power, the
Emperor abdicated in favour of his son, and three years
later he died.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s poetry, though artificially correct, was
mediocre enough. The following stanza, “On Hearing
the Cicada,” is a good example, conforming as it does to
all the rules of versification, but wanting in that one
feature which makes the “stop-short” what it is, viz.,
that “although the words end, the sense still goes on”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The season is a month behind<br /></span>
<span class="i10">in this land of northern breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first I hear the harsh cicada<br /></span>
<span class="i10">shrieking through the trees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look, but cannot mark its form<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Naught but a flash of shadow<br /></span>

train of thought, the reader is fairly entitled to ask
“What then?”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

CLASSICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE&mdash;POETRY</h3>


<p>Foremost among the scholars of the present dynasty
stands the name of <span class="smcap">Ku Chiang</span> (1612-1681). Remaining
faithful to the Mings after their final downfall, he changed
his name to Ku Yen-wu, and for a long time wandered
about the country in disguise. He declined to serve
under the Manchus, and supported himself by farming.
A profound student, it is recorded that in his wanderings
he always carried about with him several horse-loads of
books to consult whenever his memory might be at fault.
His writings on the Classics, history, topography, and
poetry are still highly esteemed. To foreigners he is
best known as the author of the <cite>Jih Chih Lu</cite>, which
contains his notes, chiefly on the Classics and history,
gathered during a course of reading which extended
over thirty years. He also wrote many works upon the
ancient sounds and rhymes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chu Yung-shun</span> (1617-1689) was delicate as a child,
and his mother made him practise the Taoist art of prolonging
life indefinitely, which seems to be nothing more
than a system of regular breathing with deep inspirations.
He was a native of a town in Kiangsu, at the sack
of which, by the conquering Tartars, his father perished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
rather than submit to the new dynasty. In consequence
of his father’s death he steadily declined to enter upon
a public career, and gave up his life to study and teaching.
He was the author of commentaries upon the Great
Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean, and of other
works; but none of these is so famous as his Family
Maxims, a little book which, on account of the author’s
name, has often been attributed to the great commentator
Chu Hsi. The piquancy of these maxims disappears in
translation, owing as they do much more to literary form
than to subject-matter. Here are two specimens:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Forget the good deeds you have done; remember
the kindnesses you have received.”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business, follow out your destiny,
live in accord with the age, and leave the rest to God.
He who can do this is near indeed.”</p>

<p>His own favourite saying was&mdash;</p>

<p>“To know what ought to be known, and to do what
ought to be done, that is enough. There is no time for
anything else.”</p>

<p>Three days before his death he struggled into the ancestral
hall, and there before the family tablets called
the spirits of his forefathers to witness that he had never
injured them by word or deed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LAN TING-YÜAN</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lan Ting-yüan</span> (1680-1733), better known as Lan Lu-chou,
devoted himself as a youth to poetry, literature,
and political economy. He accompanied his brother to
Formosa as military secretary, and his account of the
expedition attracted public attention. Recommended to
the Emperor, he became magistrate of P’u-lin, and distinguished
himself as much by his just and incorrupt
administration as by his literary abilities. He managed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
however, to make enemies among his superior officers,
and within three years he was impeached for insubordination
and thrown into prison. His case was subsequently
laid before the Emperor, who not only set him
free, but appointed him to be Prefect at Canton, bestowing
upon him at the same time some valuable medicine,
an autograph copy of verses, a sable robe, some joss-stick,
and other coveted marks of Imperial favour. But
all was in vain. He died of a broken heart one month
after taking up his post. His complete works have been
published in twenty small octavo volumes, of which
works perhaps the best known of all is a treatise on the
proper training of women, which fills two of the above
volumes. This is divided under four heads, namely,
Virtue, Speech, Personal Appearance, and Duty, an
extended education in the intellectual sense not coming
within the writer’s purview. The chapters are short,
and many of them are introduced by some ancient
aphorism, forming a convenient peg upon which to
hang a moral lesson, copious extracts being made from
the work of the Lady Pan of the Han dynasty. A few
lines from his preface may be interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good government of the empire depends upon
morals; correctness of morals depends upon right ordering
of the family; and right ordering of the family
depends upon the wife.... If the curtain which
divides the men from the women is too thin to keep
them apart, misfortune will come to the family and
to the State. Purification of morals, from the time of
the creation until now, has always come from women.
Women are not all alike; some are good and some
are bad. For bringing them to a proper uniformity
there is nothing like education. In old days both boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and girls were educated ... but now the books used
no longer exist, and we know not the details of the
system.... The education of a woman is not like that
of her husband, which may be said to continue daily
all through life. For he can always take up a classic
or a history, or familiarise himself with the works of
miscellaneous writers; whereas a woman’s education
does not extend beyond ten years, after which she takes
upon herself the manifold responsibilities of a household.
She is then no longer able to give her undivided
attention to books, and cannot investigate thoroughly,
the result being that her learning is not sufficiently extensive
to enable her to grasp principles. She is, as it
were, carried away upon a flood, without hope of return,
and it is difficult for her to make any use of the knowledge
she has acquired. Surely then a work on the
education of women is much to be desired.”</p>

<p>This is how one phase of female virtue is illustrated by
anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A man having been killed in a brawl, two brothers
were arrested for the murder and brought to trial. Each
one swore that he personally was the murderer, and that
the other was innocent. The judge was thus unable to
decide the case, and referred it to the Prince. The
Prince bade him summon their mother, and ask which
of them had done the deed. ‘Punish the younger,’ she
replied through a flood of tears. ‘People are usually
more fond of the younger,’ observed the judge; ‘how
is it you wish me to punish him?’ ‘He is my own
child,’ answered the woman; ‘the elder is the son of
my husband’s first wife. When my husband died he
begged me to take care of the boy, and I promised I
would. If now I were to let the elder be punished while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
the younger escaped, I should be only gratifying my
private feelings and wronging the dead. I have no
alternative.’ And she wept on until her clothes were
drenched with tears. Meanwhile the judge reported to
the Prince, and the latter, astonished at her magnanimity,
pardoned both the accused.”</p>

<p>Two more of the above twenty volumes are devoted
to the most remarkable of the criminal cases tried by
him during his short magisterial career. An extract
from the preface (1729) to his complete works, penned
by an ardent admirer, will give an idea of the estimation
in which these are held:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My master’s judicial capacity was of a remarkably
high order, as though the mantle of Pao Hsiao-su<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> had
descended upon him. In very difficult cases he would
investigate dispassionately and calmly, appearing to
possess some unusual method for worming out the
truth; so that the most crafty lawyers and the most
experienced scoundrels, whom no logic could entangle
and no pains intimidate, upon being brought before
him, found themselves deserted by their former cunning,
and confessed readily without waiting for the application
of torture. I, indeed, have often wondered how
it is that torture is brought into requisition so much
in judicial investigations. For, under the influence of
the ‘three wooden instruments,’ what evidence is there
which cannot be elicited?&mdash;to say nothing of the danger
of a mistake and the unutterable injury thus inflicted
upon the departed spirits in the realms below. Now,
my master, in investigating and deciding cases, was
fearful only lest his people should not obtain a full and
fair hearing; he, therefore, argued each point with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
quietly and kindly until they were thoroughly committed
to a certain position, with no possibility of backing out,
and then he decided the case upon its merits as thus
set forth. By such means, those who were bambooed
had no cause for complaint, while those who were condemned
to die died without resenting their sentence;
the people were unable to deceive him, and they did not
even venture to make the attempt. Thus did he carry out
the Confucian doctrine of respecting popular feeling;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
and were all judicial officers to decide cases in the same
careful and impartial manner, there would not be a single
injured suitor under the canopy of heaven.”</p>

<p>The following is a specimen case dealing with the evil
effects of superstitious doctrines:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The people of the Ch’ao-yang district are great on
bogies, and love to talk of spirits and Buddhas. The
gentry and their wives devote themselves to Ta Tien,
but the women generally of the neighbourhood flock
in crowds to the temples to burn incense and adore
Buddha, forming an unbroken string along the road.
Hence, much ghostly and supernatural nonsense gets
spread about; and hence it was that the Hou-t’ien sect
came to flourish. I know nothing of the origin of this
sect. It was started amongst the Ch’ao-yang people by
two men, named Yen and Chou respectively, who said
that they had been instructed by a white-bearded
Immortal, and who, when an attempt to arrest them
was made by a predecessor in office, absconded with
their families and remained in concealment. By and by,
however, they came back, calling themselves the White
Lily or the White Aspen sect. I imagine that White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Lily was the real designation, the alteration in name
being simply made to deceive. Their ‘goddess’ was
Yen’s own wife, and she pretended to be able to summon
wind and bring down rain, enslave bogies and exorcise
spirits, being assisted in her performances by her paramour,
a man named Hu, who called himself the Immortal
of Pencil Peak. He used to aid in writing out charms,
spirting water, curing diseases, and praying for heirs;
and he could enable widows to hold converse with their
departed husbands. The whole district was taken in by
these people, and went quite mad about them, people
travelling from afar to worship them as spiritual guides,
and, with many offerings of money, meats, and wines,
enrolling themselves as their humble disciples, until one
would have said it was market-day in the neighbourhood.
I heard of their doings one day as I was returning
from the prefectural city. They had already established
themselves in a large building to the north of the district;
they had opened a preaching-hall, collected several
hundred persons together, and for the two previous days
had been availing themselves of the services of some
play-actors to sing and perform at their banquets. I
immediately sent off constables to arrest them; but the
constables were afraid of incurring the displeasure of the
spirits and being seized by the soldiers of the infernal
regions, while so much protection was afforded by
various families of wealth and position that the guilty
parties succeeded in preventing the arrest of a single one
of their number. Therefore I proceeded in person to
their establishment, knocked at the door, and seized the
goddess, whom I subjected to a searching examination
as to the whereabouts of her accomplices; but the
interior of the place being, as it was, a perfect maze of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
passages ramifying in every direction, when I seized a
torch and made my way along, even if I did stumble up
against any one, they were gone in a moment before I
had time to see where. It was a veritable nest of secret
villany, and one which I felt ought to be searched to the
last corner. Accordingly, from the goddess’s bed in a
dark and out-of-the-way chamber I dragged forth some
ten or a dozen men; while out of the Immortal’s bedroom
I brought a wooden seal of office belonging to the
Lady of the Moon, also a copy of their magic ritual,
a quantity of soporifics, wigs, clothes, and ornaments,
of the uses of which I was then totally ignorant. I
further made a great effort to secure the person of the
Immortal himself; and when his friends and rich supporters
saw the game was up, they surrendered him over
to justice. At his examination he comported himself in
a very singular manner, such being indeed the chief
means upon which he relied, besides the soporifics and
fine dresses, to deceive the eyes and ears of the public.
As to his credulous dupes, male and female, when they
heard the name of the Lady of the Moon they would be
at first somewhat scared; but by and by, seeing that the
goddess was certainly a woman, they would begin to
regain courage, while the Immortal himself, with his
hair dressed out and his face powdered and his skirts
fluttering about, hovered round the goddess, and assuming
all the airs and graces of a supernatural beauty,
soon convinced the spectators that he was really the
Lady of the Moon, and quite put them off the scent as
to his real sex. Adjourning now to one of the more
remote apartments, there would follow worship of
Maitrêya Buddha, accompanied by the recital of some
<i>sûtra</i>; after which soporific incense would be lighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and the victims be thrown into a deep sleep. This
soporific, or ‘soul confuser,’ as it is otherwise called,
makes people feel tired and sleepy; they are recovered
by means of a charm and a draught of cold water. The
promised heirs and the interviews with deceased husbands
are all supposed to be brought about during
the period of trance&mdash;for which scandalous impostures
the heads of these villains hung up in the streets were
scarcely a sufficient punishment. However, reflecting
that it would be a great grievance to the people were
any of them to find themselves mixed up in such a
case just after a bad harvest, and also that among
the large number who had become affiliated to this
society there would be found many old and respectable
families, I determined on a plan which would put an end
to the affair without any troublesome <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esclandre</i>. I burnt
all the depositions in which names were given, and took
no further steps against the persons named. I ordered
the goddess and her paramour to receive their full
complement of blows (viz., one hundred), and to be
punished with the heavy <i>cangue</i>; and, placing them at
the yamên gate, I let the people rail and curse at them,
tear their flesh and break their heads, until they passed
together into their boasted Paradise. The husband and
some ten others of the gang were placed in the <i>cangue</i>,
bambooed, or punished in some way; and as for the
rest, they were allowed to escape with this one more
chance to turn over a new leaf. I confiscated the building,
destroyed its disgraceful hiding-places, changed the
whole appearance of the place, and made it into a
literary institution to be dedicated to five famous heroes
of literature. I cleansed and purified it from all taint,
and on the 1st and 15th of each moon I would, when at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
leisure, indulge with the scholars of the district in literary
recreations. I formed, in fact, a literary club; and,
leasing a plot of ground for cultivation, devoted the
returns therefrom to the annual Confucian demonstrations
and to the payment of a regular professor. Thus
the true doctrine was caused to flourish, and these
supernatural doings to disappear from the scene; the
public tone was elevated, and the morality of the place
vastly improved.</p>

<p>“When the Brigadier-General and the Lieutenant-Governor
heard what had been done, they very much
commended my action, saying: ‘Had this sect not been
rooted out, the evil results would have been dire indeed;
and had you reported the case in the usual way, praying
for the execution of these criminals, your merit would
undoubtedly have been great; but now, without selfish
regard to your own interests, you have shown yourself
unwilling to hunt down more victims than necessary, or
to expose those doings in such a manner as to lead to
the suicide of the persons implicated. Such care for
the fair fame of so many people is deserving of all
praise.’”</p>

<p>Although not yet of the same national importance as
at the present day, it was still impossible that the foreign
question should have escaped the notice of such an
observant man as Lan Ting-yüan. He flourished at a
time when the spread of the Roman Catholic religion
was giving just grounds for apprehension to thoughtful
Chinese statesmen. Accordingly, we find amongst his
collected works two short notices devoted to a consideration
of trade and general intercourse with the various
nations of barbarians. They are interesting as the untrammelled
views of the greatest living Chinese scholar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of the date at which they were written, namely, in 1732.
The following is one of these notices:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To allow the barbarians to settle at Canton was a
mistake. Ever since Macao was given over, in the reign
of Chia Ching (1522-1567) of the Ming dynasty, to the
red-haired barbarians, all manner of nations have continued
without ceasing to flock thither. They build
forts and fortifications and dense settlements of houses.
Their descendants will overshadow the land, and all the
country beyond Hsiang-shan will become a kingdom
of devils. ‘Red-haired’ is a general term for the barbarians
of the western islands. Amongst them there are
the Dutch, French, Spaniards, Portuguese, English, and
Yü-sŭ-la [? Islam], all of which nations are horribly
fierce. Wherever they go they spy around with a view
to seize on other people’s territory. There was Singapore,
which was originally a Malay country; the red-haired
barbarians went there to trade, and by and by
seized it for an emporium of their own. So with the
Philippines, which were colonised by the Malays;
because the Roman Catholic religion was practised
there, the Western foreigners appropriated it in like
manner for their own. The Catholic religion is now
spreading over China. In Hupeh, Hunan, Honan,
Kiangsi, Fuhkien, and Kuangsi, there are very few
places whither it has not reached. In the first year
of the Emperor Yung Chêng [1736], the Viceroy of
Fuhkien, Man Pao, complained that the Western
foreigners were preaching their religion and tampering
with the people, to the great detriment of the
localities in question; and he petitioned that the
Roman Catholic chapels in the various provinces
might be turned into lecture-rooms and schools, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
that all Western foreigners might be sent to Macao, to
wait until an opportunity should present itself of sending
them back to their own countries. However, the
Viceroy of Kuangtung, out of mistaken kindness, memorialised
the Throne that such of the barbarians as were
old or sick and unwilling to go away might be permitted
to remain in the Roman Catholic establishment
at Canton, on the condition that if they proselytised,
spread their creed, or chaunted their sacred books,
they were at once to be punished and sent away. The
scheme was an excellent one, but what were the results
of it? At present more than 10,000 men have joined
the Catholic chapel at Canton, and there is also a
department for women, where they have similarly got
together about 2000. This is a great insult to China,
and seriously injures our national traditions, enough
to make every man of feeling grind his teeth with rage.
The case by no means admits of ‘teaching before
punishing.’</p>

<p>“Now these traders come this immense distance with
the object of making money. What then is their idea in
paying away vast sums in order to attract people to
their faith? Thousands upon thousands they get to
join them, not being satisfied until they have bought up
the whole province. Is it possible to shut one’s eyes
and stop one’s ears, pretending to know nothing about
it and making no inquiries whatever? There is an old
saying among the people&mdash;‘Take things in time. A
little stream, if not stopped, may become a great river.’
How much more precaution is needed, then, when there
is a general inundation and men’s hearts are restless and
disturbed? In Canton the converts to Catholicism are
very numerous; those in Macao are in an inexpugnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
fortress. There is a constant interchange of arms
between the two, and if any trouble like that of the
Philippines or Singapore should arise, I cannot say
how we should meet it. At the present moment, with
a pattern of Imperial virtue on the Throne, whose
power and majesty have penetrated into the most
distant regions, this foolish design of the barbarians
should on no account be tolerated. Wise men will
do well to be prepared against the day when it may
be necessary for us to retire before them, clearing the
country as we go.”</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter to a friend was
written by Lan Ting-yüan in 1724, and proves that if
he objected to Christianity, he was not one whit more
inclined to tolerate Buddhism:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Of all the eighteen provinces, Chehkiang is the one
where Buddhist priests and nuns most abound. In the
three prefectures of Hangchow, Chia-hsing, and Huchow
there cannot be fewer than several tens of thousands of
them, of whom, by the way, not more than one-tenth
have willingly taken the vows. The others have been
given to the priests when quite little, either because
their parents were too poor to keep them, or in return
for some act of kindness; and when the children grow
up, they are unable to get free. Buddhist nuns are also
in most cases bought up when children as a means of
making a more extensive show of religion, and are carefully
prevented from running away. They are not given
in marriage&mdash;the desire for which is more or less implanted
in every human breast, and exists even amongst
prophets and sages. And thus to condemn thousands
and ten thousands of human beings to the dull monotony
of the cloister, granting that they strictly keep their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
religious vows, is more than sufficient to seriously interfere
with the equilibrium of the universe. Hence
floods, famines, and the like catastrophes; to say
nothing of the misdeeds of the nuns in question.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“When I passed through Soochow and Hangchow I
saw many disgraceful advertisements that quite took my
breath away with their barefaced depravity; and the
people there told me that these atrocities were much
practised by the denizens of the cloister, which term is
simply another name for houses of ill-fame. These
cloister folk do a great deal of mischief amongst the
populace, wasting the substance of some, and robbing
others of their good name.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Ming Chi Kang Mu</cite>, or History of the Ming
Dynasty, which had been begun in 1689 by a commission
of fifty-eight scholars, was laid before the Emperor only
in 1742 by <span class="smcap">Chang T’ing-yü</span> (1670-1756), a Minister
of State and a most learned writer, joint editor of the
Book of Rites, Ritual of the Chou Dynasty, the Thirteen
Classics, the Twenty-four Histories, Thesaurus of
Phraseology, Encyclopædia of Quotations, the Concordance
to Literature, &amp;c. This work, however, did
not meet with the Imperial approval, and for it was
substituted the <cite>T’ung Chien Kang Mu San Pien</cite>, first
published in 1775. Among the chief collaborators of
Chang T’ing-yü should be mentioned <span class="smcap">O-êrh-t’ai</span>, the
Mongol (<i>d.</i> 1745), and <span class="smcap">Chu Shih</span> (1666-1736), both of
whom were also voluminous contributors to classical
literature.</p>

<p>These were followed by <span class="smcap">Ch’ên Hung-mou</span> (1695-1771),
who, besides being the author of brilliant State papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
was a commentator on the Classics, dealing especially
with the Four Books, a writer on miscellaneous topics,
and a most successful administrator. He rose to high
office, and was noted for always having his room hung
round with maps of the province in which he was
serving, so that he might become thoroughly familiar
with its geography. He was dismissed, however, from
the important post of Viceroy of the Two Kuang for
alleged incapacity in dealing with a plague of locusts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">YÜAN MEI</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yüan Mei</span> (1715-1797) is beyond all question the most
popular writer of modern times. At the early age of
nine he was inspired with a deep love for poetry, and
soon became an adept at the art. Graduating in 1739,
he was shortly afterwards sent to Kiangnan, and
presently became magistrate at Nanking, where he
greatly distinguished himself by the vigour and justice
of his administration. A serious illness kept him for
some time unemployed; and when on recovery he was
sent into Shansi, he managed to quarrel with the Viceroy.
At the early age of forty he retired from the official
arena and led a life of lettered ease in his beautiful
garden at Nanking. His letters, which have been
published under the title of <cite>Hsiao Ts’ang Shan Fang
Ch’ih Tu</cite>, are extremely witty and amusing, and at the
same time are models of style. Many of the best are a
trifle coarse, sufficiently so to rank them with some of the
eighteenth-century literature on this side of the globe;
the salt of all loses its savour in translation. The
following are specimens:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have received your letter congratulating me on my
present prosperity, and am very much obliged for the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>“At the end of the letter, however, you mention that
you have a tobacco-pouch for me, which shall be sent on
as soon as I forward you a stanza. Surely this reminds
one of the evil days of the Chous and the Chêngs, when
each State took pledges from the other. It certainly is
not in keeping with the teaching of the sages, viz., that
friends should be the first to give. Why then do you
neglect that teaching for the custom of a degraded age?</p>

<p>“If for a tobacco-pouch you insist upon having a
stanza, for a hat or a pair of boots you would want
at least a poem; while your brother might send me a
cloak or a coat, and expect to get a whole epic in return!
In this way, the prosperity on which you congratulate me
would not count for much.</p>

<p>“Shun Yü-t’an of old sacrificed a bowl of rice and
a perch to get a hundred waggons full of grain; he
offered little and he wanted much. And have you not
heard how a thousand pieces of silk were given for a
single word? two beautiful girls for a stanza?&mdash;compared
with which your tobacco-pouch seems small indeed. It
is probably because you are a military man, accustomed
to drill soldiers and to reward them with a silver medal
when they hit the mark, that you have at last come to
regard this as the proper treatment of an old friend.</p>

<p>“Did not Mencius forbid us to presume upon anything
adventitious? And if friends may not presume
upon their worth or position, how much less upon a
tobacco-pouch? For a tobacco-pouch, pretty as it may
be, is but the handiwork of a waiting-maid; while my
verses, poor as they may be, are the outcome of my
intellectual powers. So that to exchange the work of a
waiting-maid’s fingers for the work of my brain, is a
great compliment to the waiting-maid, but a small one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
me. Not so if you yourself had cast away spear and
sword, and grasping the needle and silk, had turned me
out a tobacco-pouch of your own working. Then, had
you asked me even for ten stanzas, I would freely have
given them. But a great general knows his own strength
as well as the enemy’s, and it would hardly be proper for
me to lure you from men’s to women’s work, and place
on your head a ribboned cap. How then do you venture
to treat me as Ts’ao Ts’ao [on his death-bed treated
his concubines], by bestowing on me an insignificant
tobacco-pouch?</p>

<p>“Having nothing better to do, I have amused myself
with these few lines at your expense. If you take them
ill, of course I shall never get the pouch. But if you
can mend your evil ways, then hurry up with the
tobacco-pouch and trust to your luck for the verse.”</p>

<p>A friend had sent Yüan Mei a letter with the very un-Chinese
present of a crab and a duck. Two ducks and
a crab would have been more conventional, or even two
crabs and a duck. And by some mistake or other, the
crab arrived by itself. Hence the following banter in
reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To convey a man to a crab is very pleasant for the
man, but to convey a crab to a man is pleasant for his
whole family. And I know that this night my two sons
will often bend their arms like crabs’ claws [<i>i.e.</i> in the
form of the Chinese salute], wishing you an early success
in life.</p>

<p>“In rhyme no duplicates [that is, don’t rhyme again
the same sound], and don’t use two sentences where
one will do [in composition]. Besides which, the fact
that the duck has not yet turned up shows that you
understand well how to ‘do one thing at a time.’ Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
to mention that you cause an old gobbler like myself to
stretch out his neck in anticipation of something else to
come.</p>

<p>“You remember how the poet Shên beat his rival,
all because of that one verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Sigh not for the sinking moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jewel lamp will follow soon.’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Well, your crab is like the sinking moon, while the duck
reminds me of the jewel lamp; from which we may
infer that you will meet with the same good luck as
Shên.</p>

<p>“Again, a crab, even in the presence of the King of
the Ocean, has to travel aslant; by which same token I
trust that by and by your fame will travel aslant the
habitable globe.”</p>

<p>Yüan Mei’s poetry is much admired and widely read.
He is one of the few, very few, poets who have flourished
under Manchu rule. Here are some sarcastic lines by
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I’ve ever thought it passing odd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How all men reverence some God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wear their lives out for his sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bow their heads until they ache.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis clear to me the Gods are made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the same stuff as wind or shade....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! if they came to every caller,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d be the very loudest bawler!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He could be pathetic enough at times, as he showed
in his elegy on a little five-year-old daughter, recalling
her baby efforts with the paint-brush, and telling how
she cut out clothes from paper, or sat and watched her
father engaged in composition. He was also, like all
Chinese poets, an ardent lover of nature, and a winter
plum-tree in flower, or a gust of wind scattering dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
leaves, would set all his poetic fibres thrilling again.
It sounds like an anti-climax to add that this brilliant
essayist, letter-writer, and composer of finished verse
owes perhaps the chief part of his fame to a cookery-book.
Yet such is actually the case. Yüan Mei was the
Brillat-Savarin of China, and in the art of cooking China
stands next to France. His cookery-book is a gossipy
little work, written, as only such a scholar could write
it, in a style which at once invests the subject with
dignity and interest.</p>

<p>“Everything,” says Yüan Mei, in his opening chapter,
“has its own original constitution, just as each man
has certain natural characteristics. If a man’s natural
abilities are of a low order, Confucius and Mencius
themselves would teach him to no purpose. And if an
article of food is in itself bad, not even I-ya [the Soyer
of China] could cook a flavour into it.</p>

<p>“A ham is a ham; but in point of goodness two hams
will be as widely separated as sky and sea. A mackerel
is a mackerel; but in point of excellence two mackerel
will differ as much as ice and live coals. And other
things in the same way. So that the credit of a good
dinner should be divided between the cook and the
steward forty per cent. to the steward, and sixty per
cent. to the cook.</p>

<p>“Cookery is like matrimony. Two things served together
should match. Clear should go with clear, thick
with thick, hard with hard, and soft with soft. I have
known people mix grated lobster with birds’-nests, and
mint with chicken or pork!</p>

<p>“The cooks of to-day think nothing of mixing in one
soup the meat of chicken, duck, pig, and goose. But
these chickens, ducks, pigs, and geese have doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
souls. And these souls will most certainly file plaints in
the next world on the way they have been treated in
this. A good cook will use plenty of different dishes.
Each article of food will be made to exhibit its own
characteristics, while each made dish will be characterised
by one dominant flavour. Then the palate of the
gourmand will respond without fail, and the flowers of
the soul blossom forth.</p>

<p>“Let salt fish come first, and afterwards food of more
negative flavour. Let the heavy precede the light. Let
dry dishes precede those with gravy. No flavour must
dominate. If a guest eats his fill of savouries, his
stomach will be fatigued. Salt flavours must be relieved
by bitter or hot tasting foods, in order to restore the
palate. Too much wine will make the stomach dull.
Sour or sweet food will be required to rouse it again
into vigour.</p>

<p>“In winter we should eat beef and mutton. In summer,
dried and preserved meats. As for condiments,
mustard belongs specially to summer, pepper to winter.</p>

<p>“Don’t cut bamboo-shoots [the Chinese equivalent of
asparagus] with an oniony knife.... A good cook frequently
wipes his knife, frequently changes his cloth,
frequently scrapes his board, and frequently washes his
hands. If smoke or ashes from his pipe, perspiration-drops
from his head, insects from the wall, or smuts
from the saucepan get mixed up with the food, though
he were a very <i>chef</i> among <i>chefs</i>, yet would men hold
their noses and decline.</p>

<p>“Don’t make your thick sauces greasy nor your clear
ones tasteless. Those who want grease can eat fat
pork, while a drink of water is better than something
which tastes of nothing at all.... Don’t over-salt your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
soups; for salt can be added to taste, but can never be
taken away.</p>

<p>“<em>Don’t eat with your ears</em>; by which I mean do not
aim at having extraordinary out-of-the-way foods, just
to astonish your guests; for that is to eat with your
ears, not with the mouth. Bean-curd, if good, is actually
nicer than birds’-nest; and better than sea-slugs, which
are not first-rate, is a dish of bamboo shoots....</p>

<p>“The chicken, the pig, the fish, and the duck, these
are the four heroes of the table. Sea-slugs and birds’-nests
have no characteristic flavours of their own. They
are but usurpers in the house. I once dined with a
friend who gave us birds’-nest in bowls more like vats,
holding each about four ounces of the plain-boiled
article. The other guests applauded vigorously; but I
smiled and said, ‘<em>I came here to eat birds’-nest, not to take
delivery of it wholesale.</em>’</p>

<p>“<em>Don’t eat with your eyes</em>; by which I mean do not
cover the table with innumerable dishes and multiply
courses indefinitely. For this is to eat with the eyes,
and not with the mouth.</p>

<p>“Just as a calligraphist should not overtire his hand
nor a poet his brain, so a good cook cannot possibly
turn out in one day more than four or five distinct <i>plats</i>.
I used to dine with a merchant friend who would put on
no less than three removes [sets of eight dishes served
separately], and sixteen kinds of sweets, so that by the
time we had finished we had got through a total of some
forty courses. My host gloried in all this, but when I
got home I used to have a bowl of rice-gruel. I felt so
hungry.</p>

<p>“To know right from wrong, a man must be sober.
And only a sober man can distinguish good flavours from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
bad. It has been well said that words are inadequate to
describe the <i>nuances</i> of taste. How much less then must
a stuttering sot be able to appreciate them!</p>

<p>“I have often seen votaries of guess-fingers swallow
choice food as though so much sawdust, their minds
being preoccupied with their game. Now I say eat first
and drink afterwards. By these means the result will
be successful in each direction.”</p>

<p>Yüan Mei also protests against the troublesome custom
of pressing guests to eat, and against the more foolish
one of piling up choice pieces on the little saucers used
as plates, and even putting them into the guests’ mouths,
as if they were children or brides, too shy to help
themselves.</p>

<p>There was a man in Ch’ang-an, he tells us, who was
very fond of giving dinners; but the food was atrocious.
One day a guest threw himself on his knees in front of
this gentleman and said, “Am I not a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“You are indeed,” replied his host.</p>

<p>“Then I must ask of you a favour,” said the guest,
“and you must grant it before I rise from my knees.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” inquired his host in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Never to invite me to dinner any more!” cried the
guest; at which the whole party burst into a loud roar
of laughter.</p>

<p>“Into no department of life,” says Yüan Mei, “should
indifference be allowed to creep; into none less than
into the domain of cookery. Cooks are but mean
fellows; and if a day is passed without either rewarding
or punishing them, that day is surely marked by
negligence or carelessness on their part. If badly
cooked food is swallowed in silence, such neglect will
speedily become a habit. Still, mere rewards and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
punishments are of no use. If a dish is good, attention
should be called to the why and the wherefore. If
bad, an effort should be made to discover the cause of
the failure.</p>

<p>“I am not much of a wine-drinker, but this makes
me all the more particular. Wine is like scholarship:
it ripens with age; and it is best from a fresh-opened
jar. The top of the wine-jar, the bottom of the teapot,
as the saying has it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CH’ÊN HAO-TZŬ</div>

<p>In 1783 <span class="smcap">Ch’ên Hao-tzŭ</span>, who lived beside the Western
Lake at Hangchow, and called himself the Flower
Hermit, published a gossipy little work on gardening
and country pursuits, under the title of “The Mirror of
Flowers.” It is the type of a class often to be seen in
the hands of Chinese readers. The preface was written
by himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“From my youth upwards I have cared for nothing
save books and flowers. Twenty-eight thousand days
have passed over my head, the greater part of which has
been spent in poring over old records, and the remainder
in enjoying myself in my garden among plants
and birds.”</p>

<p>The Chinese excel in horticulture, and the passionate
love of flowers which prevails among all classes is quite
a national characteristic. A Chinaman, however, has his
own particular standpoint. The vulgar nosegay or the
plutocratic bouquet would have no charms for him. He
can see, with satisfaction, only one flower at a time.
His best vases are made to hold a single spray, and
large vases usually have covers perforated so as to
isolate each specimen. A primrose by the river’s brim
would be to him a complete poem. If condemned to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
sedentary life, he likes to have a flower by his side on
the table. He draws enjoyment, even inspiration, from
its petals. He will take a flower out for a walk, and
stop every now and again to consider the loveliness of
its growth. So with birds. It is a common thing on a
pleasant evening to meet a Chinaman carrying his bird-cage
suspended from the end of a short stick. He will
stop at some pleasant corner outside the town, and listen
with rapture to the bird’s song. But to the preface.
Our author goes on to say that in his hollow bamboo
pillow he always keeps some work on his favourite
subject.</p>

<p>“People laugh at me, and say that I am cracked on
flowers and a bibliomaniac; but surely study is the
proper occupation of a literary man, and as for gardening,
that is simply a rest for my brain and a relaxation
in my declining years. What does T’ao Ch’ien say?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Riches and rank I do not love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no hopes of heaven above.’ ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides, it is only in hours of leisure that I devote myself
to the cultivation of flowers.”</p>

<p>Ch’ên Hao-tzŭ then runs through the four seasons,
showing how each has its especial charm, contributing
to the sum of those pure pleasures which are the best
antidote against the ills of old age. He then proceeds to
deal with times and seasons, showing what to do under
each month, precisely as our own garden-books do.
After that come short chapters on all the chief trees,
shrubs, and plants of China, with hints how to treat
them under diverse circumstances, the whole concluding
with a separate section devoted to birds, animals, fishes,
and insects. Among these are to be found the crane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
peacock, parrot, thrush, kite, quail, mainah, swallow,
deer, hare, monkey, dog, cat, squirrel, goldfish&mdash;first
mentioned by Su Shih,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Upon the bridge the livelong day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand and watch the goldfish play”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>bee, butterfly, glowworm, &amp;c. Altogether there is much
to be learnt from this Chinese White of Selborne, and
the reader lays down the book feeling that the writer
is not far astray when he says, “If a home has not a
garden and an old tree, I see not whence the everyday
joys of life are to come.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHAO I</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chao I</span> (1727-1814) is said to have known several tens
of characters when only three years old,&mdash;the age at
which John Stuart Mill believed that he began Greek.
It was not, however, until 1761 that he took his final
degree, appearing second on the list. He was really first,
but the Emperor put Wang Chieh over his head, in
order to encourage men from Shensi, to which province
the latter belonged. That Wang Chieh is remembered
at all must be set down to the above episode, and not to
the two volumes of essays which he left behind him.
Chao I wrote a history of the wars of the present
dynasty, a collection of notes on the current topics of his
day, historical critiques, and other works. He was also
a poet, contributing a large volume of verse, from which
the following sample of his art is taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Man is indeed of heavenly birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though seeming earthy of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky is but a denser pall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the thin air that covers all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as this air, so is that sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why call this low, and call that high?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The dewdrop sparkles in the cup&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Note how the eager flowers spring up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confine and crib them in a room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fade and find an early doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ’tis that at our very feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth and the empyrean meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The babe at birth points heavenward too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enveloped by the eternal blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fishes in the water bide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So heaven surrounds on every side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet men sin on, because they say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great God in heaven is far away.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The “stop short” was a great favourite with him.
His level may be gauged by the following specimen,
written as he was setting out to a distant post in the
north:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“See where, like specks of spring-cloud in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their long northern route the wild geese fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together o’er the River we will roam....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! they go towards, and I away from home!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is another in a more humorous vein:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The rain had been raining the whole of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had been straining and working away....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What’s the trouble, O cook? You’ve no millet in store?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I’ve written a book which will buy us some more.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">FANG WEI-I</div>

<p>Taken altogether, the poetry of the present dynasty,
especially that of the nineteenth century, must be written
down as nothing more than artificial verse, with the art
not even concealed, but grossly patent to the dullest
observer. A collection of extracts from about 2000
representative poets was published in 1857, but it is very
dull reading, any thoughts, save the most commonplace,
being few and far between. As in every similar collec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>tion,
a place is assigned to poetesses, of whom <span class="smcap">Fang Wei-i</span>
would perhaps be a favourable example. She came from
a good family, and was but newly married to a promising
young official when the latter died, and left her a
sorrowing and childless widow. Light came to her in
the darkness, and disregarding the entreaties of her
father and mother, she decided to become a nun, and
devote the remainder of her life to the service of Buddha.
These are her farewell lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis common talk how partings sadden life:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There are no partings for us after death.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“Life’s sweetest boon is after all to die....<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My weeping parents still are loth to yield;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">“What will life bring to me an I should stay?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And make me conscious that at last I know.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the greatest of the scholars of the present
dynasty was <span class="smcap">Yüan Yüan</span> (1764-1849). He took his third
degree in 1789, and at the final examination the aged
Emperor Ch’ien Lung was so struck with his talents that
he exclaimed, “Who would have thought that, after passing
my eightieth year, I should find another such man as
this one?” He then held many high offices in succession,
including the post of Governor of Chehkiang, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
which he operated vigorously against the Annamese
pirates and Ts’ai Ch’ien, established the tithing system,
colleges, schools, and soup-kitchens, besides devoting
himself to the preservation of ancient monuments. As
Viceroy of the Two Kuang, he frequently came into
collision with British interests, and did his best to keep
a tight hand over the barbarian merchants. He was a
voluminous writer on the Classics, astronomy, archæology,
&amp;c., and various important collections were produced
under his patronage. Among these may be mentioned
the <cite>Huang Ch’ing Ching Chieh</cite>, containing upwards
of 180 separate works, and the <cite>Ch’ou Jen Chuan</cite>, a biographical
dictionary of famous mathematicians of all
ages, including Euclid, Newton, and Ricci, the Jesuit
Father. He also published a Topography of Kuangtung,
specimens of the compositions of more than 5000 poets
of Kiangsi, and a large collection of inscriptions on bells
and vases. He also edited the Catalogue of the Imperial
Library, the large encyclopædia known as the <cite>T’ai P’ing
Yü Lan</cite>, and other important works.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE KAN YING P’IEN</div>

<p>Two religious works, associated with the Taoism of
modern days, which have long been popular throughout
China, may fitly be mentioned here. They are not to be
bought in shops, but can always be obtained at temples,
where large numbers are placed by philanthropists for
distribution gratis. The first is the <cite>Kan Ying P’ien</cite>, or
Book of Rewards and Punishments, attributed by the
foolish to Lao Tzŭ himself. Its real date is quite unknown;
moderate writers place it in the Sung dynasty,
but even that seems far too early. Although nominally
of Taoist origin, this work is usually edited in a very
pronounced Buddhist setting, the fact being that Taoism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and Buddhism are now so mixed up that it is impossible
to draw any sharp line of demarcation between the two.
As Chu Hsi says, “Buddhism stole the best features
of Taoism, and Taoism stole the worst features of Buddhism;
it is as though the one stole a jewel from the
other, and the loser recouped the loss with a stone.”
Prefixed to the <cite>Kan Ying P’ien</cite> will be found Buddhist
formulæ for cleansing the mouth and body before
beginning to read the text, and appeals to Maitrêya
Buddha and Avalôkitêsvara. Married women and girls
are advised not to frequent temples to be a spectacle for
men. “If you must worship Buddha, worship the two
living Buddhas (parents) you have at home; and if you
must burn incense, burn it at the family altar.” We are
further told that there is no time at which this book may
not be read; no place in which it may not be read; and
no person by whom it may not be read with profit. We
are advised to study it when fasting, and not necessarily
to shout it aloud, so as to be heard of men, but rather to
ponder over it in the heart. The text consists of a commination
said to have been uttered by Lao Tzŭ, and
directed against evil-doers of all kinds. In the opening
paragraphs attention is drawn to various spiritual beings
who note down the good deeds and crimes of men,
and lengthen or shorten their lives accordingly. Then
follows a long list of wicked acts which will inevitably
bring retribution in their train. These include the ordinary
offences recognised by moral codes all over the
world, every form of injustice and oppression, falsehood,
and theft, together with not a few others of a more
venial character to Western minds. Among the latter
are birds’-nesting, stepping across food or human beings,
cooking with dirty firewood, spitting at shooting stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and pointing at the rainbow, or even at the sun, moon,
and stars. In all these cases, periods will be cut off from
the life of the offender, and if his life is exhausted while
any guilt still remains unexpiated, the punishment due
will be carried on to the account of his descendants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE YÜ LI CH’AO CHUAN</div>

<p>The second of the two works under consideration is
the <cite>Yü Li Ch’ao Chuan</cite>, a description of the Ten Courts
of Purgatory in the nether world, through some or all of
which every erring soul must pass before being allowed
to be born again into this world under another form,
or to be permanently transferred to the eternal bliss
reserved for the righteous alone.</p>

<p>In the Fifth Court, for instance, the sinners are hurried
away by bull-headed, horse-faced demons to a famous
terrace, where their physical punishments are aggravated
by a view of their old homes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This terrace is curved in front like a bow; it looks
east, west, and south. It is eighty-one <i>li</i> from one
extreme to the other. The back part is like the string
of a bow; it is enclosed by a wall of sharp swords.
It is 490 feet high; its sides are knife-blades; and the
whole is in sixty-three storeys. No good shade comes
to this terrace; neither do those whose balance of good
and evil is exact. Wicked souls alone behold their
homes close by, and can see and hear what is going on.
They hear old and young talking together; they see
their last wishes disregarded and their instructions disobeyed.
Everything seems to have undergone a change.
The property they scraped together with so much
trouble is dissipated and gone. The husband thinks of
taking another wife; the widow meditates second nuptials.
Strangers are in possession of the old estate; there
is nothing to divide amongst the children. Debts long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
since paid are brought again for settlement, and the
survivors are called upon to acknowledge claims upon
the departed. Debts owed are lost for want of evidence,
with endless recriminations, abuse, and general confusion,
all of which falls upon the three families of the
deceased. They in their anger speak ill of him that is
gone. He sees his children become corrupt and his
friends fall away. Some, perhaps, for the sake of bygone
times, may stroke the coffin and let fall a tear, departing
quickly with a cold smile. Worse than that, the wife
sees her husband tortured in the yamên; the husband
sees his wife victim to some horrible disease, lands gone,
houses destroyed by flood or fire, and everything in
unutterable confusion&mdash;the reward of former sins.”</p>

<p>The Sixth Court “is a vast, noisy Gehenna, many
leagues in extent, and around it are sixteen wards.</p>

<p>“In the first, the souls are made to kneel for long
periods on iron shot. In the second, they are placed up
to their necks in filth. In the third, they are pounded
till the blood runs out. In the fourth, their mouths are
opened with iron pincers and filled full of needles. In
the fifth, they are bitten by rats. In the sixth, they are
enclosed in a net of thorns and nipped by locusts. In
the seventh, they are crushed to a jelly. In the eighth,
their skin is lacerated and they are beaten on the raw.
In the ninth, their mouths are filled with fire. In the
tenth, they are licked by flames. In the eleventh, they
are subjected to noisome smells. In the twelfth, they are
butted by oxen and trampled on by horses. In the thirteenth,
their hearts are scratched. In the fourteenth,
their heads are rubbed till their skulls come off. In the
fifteenth, they are chopped in two at the waist. In the
sixteenth, their skin is taken off and rolled up into spills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those discontented ones who rail against heaven
and revile earth, who are always finding fault either
with the wind, thunder, heat, cold, fine weather, or rain;
those who let their tears fall towards the north; who
steal the gold from the inside or scrape the gilding from
the outside of images; those who take holy names in
vain, who show no respect for written paper, who throw
down dirt and rubbish near pagodas or temples, who
use dirty cook-houses and stoves for preparing the sacrificial
meats, who do not abstain from eating beef and
dog-flesh; those who have in their possession blasphemous
or obscene books and do not destroy them,
who obliterate or tear books which teach man to be
good, who carve on common articles of household use
the symbol of the origin of all things, the Sun and
Moon and Seven Stars, the Royal Mother and the God
of Longevity on the same article, or representations of
any of the Immortals; those who embroider the Svastika
on fancy-work, or mark characters on silk, satin, or cloth,
on banners, beds, chairs, tables, or any kind of utensil;
those who secretly wear clothes adorned with the dragon
and the phœnix only to be trampled under foot, who
buy up grain and hold until the price is exorbitantly
high&mdash;all these shall be thrust into the great and noisy
Gehenna, there to be examined as to their misdeeds and
passed accordingly into one of the sixteen wards, whence,
at the expiration of their time, they will be sent for further
questioning on to the Seventh Court.”</p>

<p>The Tenth Court deals with the final stage of transmigration
previous to rebirth in the world. It appears
that in primeval ages men could remember their former
lives on earth even after having passed through Purgatory,
and that wicked persons often took advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
such knowledge. To remedy this, a Terrace of Oblivion
was built, and all shades are now sent thither, and are
forced to drink the cup of forgetfulness before they can
be born again.</p>

<p>“Whether they swallow much or little it matters not;
but sometimes there are perverse devils who altogether
refuse to drink. Then beneath their feet sharp blades
start up, and a copper tube is forced down their throats,
by which means they are compelled to swallow some.
When they have drunk, they are raised by the attendants
and escorted back by the same path. They are next
pushed on to the Bitter Bamboo floating bridge, with
torrents of rushing red water on either side. Half-way
across they perceive written in large characters on a red
cliff on the opposite side the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To be a man is easy, but to act up to one’s responsibilities as such is hard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to be a man once again is perhaps harder still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For those who would be born again in some happy state there is no great difficulty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is only necessary to keep mouth and heart in harmony.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“When the shades have read these words, they try to
jump on shore, but are beaten back into the water by
two huge devils. One has on a black official hat and
embroidered clothes; in his hand he holds a paper
pencil, and over his shoulder he carries a sharp sword.
Instruments of torture hang at his waist; fiercely he
glares out of his large round eyes and laughs a horrid
laugh. His name is Short-Life. The other has a dirty
face smeared with blood; he has on a white coat, an
abacus in his hand, and a rice-sack over his shoulder.
Around his neck hangs a string of paper money; his
brow contracts hideously and he utters long sighs. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
name is They-have-their-Reward, and his duty is to push
the shades into the red water. The wicked and foolish
rejoice at the prospect of being born once more as
human beings, but the better shades weep and mourn
that in life they did not lay up a store of virtuous acts,
and thus pass away from the state of mortals for ever.
Yet they all rush on to birth like an infatuated or drunken
crowd, and again, in their new childhood, hanker after
forbidden flavours. Then, regardless of consequences,
they begin to destroy life, and thus forfeit all claims to
the mercy and compassion of God. They take no
thought as to the end that must overtake them; and,
finally, they bring themselves once more to the same
horrid plight.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

WALL LITERATURE&mdash;JOURNALISM&mdash;WIT AND
HUMOUR&mdash;PROVERBS AND MAXIMS</h3>


<p>The death of Yüan Yüan in 1849 brings us down to the
period when China began to find herself for the first
time face to face with the foreigner. The opening of
five ports in 1842 to comparatively unrestricted trade,
followed by more ports and right of residence in Peking
from 1860, created points of contact and brought about
foreign complications to which the governors of China
had hitherto been unused. A Chinese Horace might
well complain that the audacious brood of England have
by wicked fraud introduced journalism into the Empire,
and that evils worse than consumption and fevers have
followed in its train.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROCLAMATIONS</div>

<p>From time immemorial wall-literature has been a
feature in the life of a Chinese city surpassing in extent
and variety that of any other nation, and often playing
a part fraught with much danger to the community at
large. Generally speaking, the literature of the walls
covers pretty much the same ground as an ordinary
English newspaper, from the “agony” column downwards.
For, mixed up with notices of lost property,
consisting sometimes of human beings, and advertisements
of all kinds of articles of trade, such as one would
naturally look for in the handbill literature of any city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
there are to be found announcements of new and
startling remedies for various diseases or of infallible
pills for the cure of depraved opium-smokers, long lists
of the names of subscribers to some coming festival or to
the pious restoration of a local temple, sermons without
end directed against the abuse of written paper, and now
and then against female infanticide, or Cumming-like
warnings of an approaching millennium, at which the
wicked will receive the reward of their crimes according
to the horrible arrangements of the Buddhist-Taoist purgatory.
Occasionally an objectionable person will be
advised through an anonymous placard to desist from
a course which is pointed out as offensive, and similarly,
but more rarely, the action of an official will be
sometimes severely criticised or condemned. Official
proclamations on public business can hardly be classed
as wall literature, except perhaps when, as is not uncommon,
they are written in doggerel verse, with a view
to appealing more directly to the illiterate reader. The
following proclamation establishing a registry office for
boats at Tientsin will give an idea of these queer documents,
the only parallel to which in the West might be
found in the famous lines issued by the Board of Trade
for the use of sea-captains:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Green to green, and red to red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfect safety, go ahead,” &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The object of this registry office was ostensibly to
save the poor boatman from being unfairly dealt with
when impressed at nominal wages for Government service,
but really to enable the officials to know exactly
where to lay their hands on boats when required:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that wall literature has
often been directed against foreigners, and especially
against missionaries. The penalties, however, for posting
anonymous placards are very severe, and of late
years the same end has been more effectually attained
by the circulation of abusive fly-sheets, often pictorial
and always disgusting.</p>

<p>Journalism has proved to be a terrible thorn in the
official side. It was first introduced into China under
the ægis of an Englishman who was the nominal editor
of the <cite>Shên Pao</cite> or <cite>Shanghai News</cite>, still a very influential
newspaper. For a long time the authorities fought to
get rid of this objectionable daily, which now and again
told some awkward truths, and contained many ably
written articles by first-class native scholars. Eventually
an official organ was started in opposition, and other
papers have since appeared. An illustrated Chinese
weekly made a good beginning in Shanghai, but un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>fortunately
it soon drifted into superstition, intolerance,
and vulgarity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TRANSLATIONS</div>

<p>Attempts have been made to provide the Chinese with
translations of noted European works, and among those
which have been produced may be mentioned “The
Pilgrim’s Progress,” with illustrations, the various characters
being in Chinese dress; Mr. Herbert Spencer’s
“Education,” the very first sentence in which is painfully
misrendered; the “Adventures of Baron Munchausen,”
and others. In every case save one these efforts have been
rejected by the Chinese on the ground of inferior style.
The exception was a translation of Æsop’s Fables, published
in 1840 by Robert Thom as rendered into Chinese
by an eminent native scholar. This work attracted much
attention among the people generally; so much so, that
the officials took alarm and made strenuous efforts to
suppress it. Recent years have witnessed the publication
in Chinese of “Vathek,” in reference to which a
literate of standing offered the following criticism:&mdash;“The
style in which this work is written is not so bad,
but the subject-matter is of no account.” The fact is,
that to satisfy the taste of the educated Chinese reader
the very first requisite is style. As has been seen in
the case of the <cite>Liao Chai</cite>, the Chinese will read almost
anything, provided it is set in a faultless frame. They
will not look at anything emanating from foreign sources
in which this greatest desideratum has been neglected.</p>

<p>The present age has seen the birth of no great
original writer in any department of literature, nor the
production of any great original work worthy to be
smeared with cedar-oil for the delectation of posterity.
It is customary after the death, sometimes during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
life, of any leading statesman to publish a collection of
his memorials to the throne, with possibly a few essays
and some poems. Such have a brief <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">succès d’estime</i>, and
are then used by binders for thickening the folded leaves
of some masterpiece of antiquity. Successful candidates
for the final degree usually print their winning essays,
and sometimes their poems, chiefly for distribution
among friends. Several diaries of Ministers to foreign
countries and similar books have appeared in recent
years, recording the astonishment of the writers at the
extraordinary social customs which prevail among the
barbarians. But nowadays a Chinaman who wishes to
read a book does not sit down and write one. He is
too much oppressed by the vast dimensions of his
existing literature, and by the hopelessness of rivalling,
and still more by the hopelessness of surpassing, those
immortals who have gone before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WIT AND HUMOUR</div>

<p>It would be obviously unfair to describe the Chinese
people as wanting in humour simply because they are
tickled by jests which leave us comparatively unmoved.
Few of our own most amusing stories will stand conversion
into Chinese terms. The following are specimens
of classical humour, being such as might be
introduced into any serious biographical notice of the
individuals concerned.</p>

<p>Ch’un-yü K’un (4th cent. <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) was the wit already
mentioned, who tried to entangle Mencius in his talk.
On one occasion, when the Ch’u State was about to
attack the Ch’i State, he was ordered by the Prince
of Ch’i, who was his father-in-law, to proceed to the
Chao State and ask that an army might be sent
to their assistance; to which end the Prince supplied
him with 100 lbs. of silver and ten chariots as offerings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
to the ruler of Chao. At this Ch’un-yü laughed so
immoderately that he snapped the lash of his cap; and
when the Prince asked him what was the joke, he said,
“As I was coming along this morning, I saw a husbandman
sacrificing a pig’s foot and a single cup of wine;
after which he prayed, saying, ‘O God, make my upper
terraces fill baskets and my lower terraces fill carts;
make my fields bloom with crops and my barns burst
with grain!’ And I could not help laughing at a man
who offered so little and wanted so much.” The Prince
took the hint, and obtained the assistance he required.</p>

<p>T’ao Ku (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 902-970) was an eminent official whose
name is popularly known in connection with the following
repartee. Having ordered a newly-purchased waiting-maid
to get some snow and make tea in honour of
the Feast of Lanterns, he asked her, somewhat pompously,
“Was that the custom in your former home?”
“Oh, no,” the girl replied; “they were a rough lot.
They just put up a gold-splashed awning, and had a little
music and some old wine.”</p>

<p>Li Chia-ming (10th cent. <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) was a wit at the Court
of the last ruler of the T’ang dynasty. On one occasion
the latter drew attention to some gathering clouds which
appeared about to bring rain. “They may come,” said
Li Chia-ming, “but they will not venture to enter the
city.” “Why not?” asked the Prince. “Because,”
replied the wit, “the octroi is so high.” Orders were
thereupon issued that the duties should be reduced by
one-half. On another occasion the Prince was fishing
with some of his courtiers, all of whom managed to catch
something, whereas he himself, to his great chagrin, had
not a single bite. Thereupon Li Chia-ming took a pen
and wrote the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“’Tis rapture in the warm spring days to drop the tempting fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the green pool where deep and still the darkling waters lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the fishes dare not touch the bait your Highness flings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know that only dragons are a fitting sport for kings.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Liu Chi (11th cent. <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>) was a youth who had gained
some notoriety by his fondness for strange phraseology,
which was much reprobated by the great Ou-yang Hsiu.
When the latter was Grand Examiner, one of the candidates
sent in a doggerel triplet as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The universe is in labour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things are produced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And among them the Sage.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“This must be Liu Chi,” cried Ou-yang, and ran a
red-ink pen through the composition, adding these two
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The undergraduate jokes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The examiner ploughs.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later on, about the year 1060, Ou-yang was very much
struck by the essay of a certain candidate, and placed
him first on the list. When the names were read out,
he found that the first man was Liu Chi, who had
changed his name to Liu Yün.</p>

<p>Chang Hsüan-tsu was a wit of the Han dynasty.
When he was only eight years old, some one laughed at
him for having lost several teeth, and said, “What are
those dog-holes in your mouth for?” “They are there,”
replied Chang, “to let puppies like you run in and out.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Collections of wit and humour of the Joe Miller type
are often to be seen in the hands of Chinese readers, and
may be bought at any bookstall. Like many novels of
the cheap and worthless class, not to be mentioned with
the masterpieces of fiction described in this volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
these collections are largely unfit for translation. All
literature in China is pure. Novels and stories are not
classed as literature; the authors have no desire to attach
their names to such works, and the consequence is a
great falling off from what may be regarded as the
national standard. Even the <cite>Hung Lou Mêng</cite> contains
episodes which mar to a considerable extent the beauty
of the whole. One excuse is that it is a novel of real
life, and to omit, therefore, the ordinary frailties of
mortals would be to produce an incomplete and inadequate
picture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HSIAO LIN KUANG CHI</div>

<p>The following are a few specimens of humorous anecdotes
taken from the <cite>Hsiao Lin Kuang Chi</cite>, a modern
work in four small volumes, in which the stories are
classified under twelve heads, such as Arts, Women,
Priests:&mdash;</p>

<p>A bridegroom noticing deep wrinkles on the face of
his bride, asked her how old she was, to which she
replied, “About forty-five or forty-six.” “Your age is
stated on the marriage contract,” he rejoined, “as thirty-eight;
but I am sure you are older than that, and you
may as well tell me the truth.” “I am really fifty-four,”
answered the bride. The bridegroom, however,
was not satisfied, and determined to set a trap for her.
Accordingly he said, “Oh, by the by, I must just go
and cover up the salt jar, or the rats will eat every scrap
of it.” “Well, I never!” cried the bride, taken off her
guard. “Here I’ve lived sixty-eight years, and I never
before heard of rats stealing salt.”</p>

<p>A woman who was entertaining a paramour during
the absence of her husband, was startled by hearing the
latter knock at the house-door. She hurriedly bundled
the man into a rice-sack, which she concealed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
corner of the room; but when her husband came in
he caught sight of it, and asked in a stern voice, “What
have you got in that sack?” His wife was too terrified
to answer; and after an awkward pause a voice from
the sack was heard to say, “Only rice.”</p>

<p>A scoundrel who had a deep grudge against a wealthy
man, sought out a famous magician and asked for his
help. “I can send demon soldiers and secretly cut
him off,” said the magician. “Yes, but his sons and
grandsons would inherit,” replied the other; “that
won’t do.” “I can draw down fire from heaven,” said
the magician, “and burn his house and valuables.”
“Even then,” answered the man, “his landed property
would remain; so that won’t do.” “Oh,” cried the
magician, “if your hate is so deep as all that, I have
something precious here which, if you can persuade
him to avail himself of it, will bring him and his to
utter smash.” He thereupon gave to his delighted
client a tightly closed package, which, on being opened,
was seen to contain a pen. “What spiritual power
is there in this?” asked the man. “Ah!” sighed the
magician, “you evidently do not know how many
have been brought to ruin by the use of this little
thing.”</p>

<p>A doctor who had mismanaged a case was seized by
the family and tied up. In the night he managed to
free himself, and escaped by swimming across a river.
When he got home, he found his son, who had just
begun to study medicine, and said to him, “Don’t be
in a hurry with your books; the first and most important
thing is to learn to swim.”</p>

<p>The King of Purgatory sent his lictors to earth to
bring back some skilful physician. “You must look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
for one,” said the King, “at whose door there are no
aggrieved spirits of disembodied patients.” The lictors
went off, but at the house of every doctor they visited
there were crowds of wailing ghosts hanging about. At
last they found a doctor at whose door there was only
a single shade, and cried out, “This man is evidently
the skilful one we are in search of.” On inquiry, however,
they discovered that he had only started practice
the day before.</p>

<p>A general was hard pressed in battle and on the
point of giving way, when suddenly a spirit soldier
came to his rescue and enabled him to win a great
victory. Prostrating himself on the ground, he asked
the spirit’s name. “I am the God of the Target,” replied
the spirit. “And how have I merited your godship’s
kind assistance?” inquired the general. “I am
grateful to you,” answered the spirit, “because in your
days of practice you never once hit me.”</p>

<p>A portrait-painter, who was doing very little business,
was advised by a friend to paint a picture of himself and
his wife, and to hang it out in the street as an advertisement.
This he did, and shortly afterwards his father-in-law
came along. Gazing at the picture for some time,
the latter at length asked, “Who is that woman?”
“Why, that is your daughter,” replied the artist. “Whatever
is she doing,” again inquired her father, “sitting there
with that stranger?”</p>

<p>A man who had been condemned to wear the <i>cangue</i>,
or wooden collar, was seen by some of his friends.
“What have you been doing,” they asked, “to deserve
this?” “Oh, nothing,” he replied; “I only picked up
an old piece of rope.” “And are you to be punished
thus severely,” they said, “for merely picking up an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
end of rope?” “Well,” answered the man, “the fact
is that there was a bullock tied to the other end.”</p>

<p>A man asked a friend to stay and have tea. Unfortunately
there was no tea in the house, so a servant
was sent to borrow some. Before the latter had returned
the water was already boiling, and it became
necessary to pour in more cold water. This happened
several times, and at length the boiler was overflowing
but no tea had come. Then the man’s wife said to her
husband, “As we don’t seem likely to get any tea, you
had better offer your friend a bath!”</p>

<p>A monkey, brought after death before the King of
Purgatory, begged to be reborn on earth as a man.
“In that case,” said the King, “all the hairs must be
plucked out of your body,” and he ordered the attendant
demons to pull them out forthwith. At the very first
hair, however, the monkey screeched out, and said he
could not bear the pain. “You brute!” roared the King,
“how are you to become a man if you cannot even part
with a single hair?”</p>

<p>A braggart chess-player played three games with a
stranger and lost them all. Next day a friend asked
him how he had come off. “Oh,” said he, “I didn’t
win the first game, and my opponent didn’t lose the
second. As for the third, I wanted to draw it, but he
wouldn’t agree.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROVERBS</div>

<p>The barest sketch of Chinese literature would hardly
be complete without some allusion to its proverbs and
maxims. These are not only to be found largely scattered
throughout every branch of writing, classical and
popular, but may also be studied in collections, generally
under a metrical form. Thus the <cite>Ming Hsien Chi</cite>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
take one example, which can be purchased anywhere
for about a penny, consists of thirty pages of proverbs
and the like, arranged in antithetical couplets of five, six,
and seven characters to each line. Children are made
to learn these by heart, and ordinary grown-up Chinamen
may be almost said to think in proverbs. There
can be no doubt that to the foreigner a large store of
proverbs, committed to memory and judiciously introduced,
are a great aid to successful conversation. These
are a few taken from an inexhaustible supply, omitting
to a great extent such as find a ready equivalent in
English:&mdash;</p>

<p>Deal with the faults of others as gently as with your
own.</p>

<p>By many words wit is exhausted.</p>

<p>If you bow at all, bow low.</p>

<p>If you take an ox, you must give a horse.</p>

<p>A man thinks he knows, but a woman knows better.</p>

<p>Words whispered on earth sound like thunder in
heaven.</p>

<p>If fortune smiles&mdash;who doesn’t? If fortune doesn’t&mdash;who
does?</p>

<p>Moneyed men are always listened to.</p>

<p>Nature is better than a middling doctor.</p>

<p>Stay at home and reverence your parents; why travel
afar to worship the gods?</p>

<p>A bottle-nosed man may be a teetotaller, but no one
will think so.</p>

<p>It is easier to catch a tiger than to ask a favour.</p>

<p>With money you can move the gods; without it, you
can’t move a man.</p>

<p>Bend your head if the eaves are low.</p>

<p>Oblige, and you will be obliged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t put two saddles on one horse.</p>

<p>Armies are maintained for years, to be used on a
single day.</p>

<p>In misfortune, gold is dull; in happiness, iron is
bright.</p>

<p>More trees are upright than men.</p>

<p>If you fear that people will know, don’t do it.</p>

<p>Long visits bring short compliments.</p>

<p>If you are upright and without guile, what god need
you pray to for pardon?</p>

<p>Some study shows the need for more.</p>

<p>One kind word will keep you warm for three winters.</p>

<p>The highest towers begin from the ground.</p>

<p>No needle is sharp at both ends.</p>

<p>Straight trees are felled first.</p>

<p>No image-maker worships the gods. He knows what
stuff they are made of.</p>

<p>Half an orange tastes as sweet as a whole one.</p>

<p>We love our own compositions, but other men’s wives.</p>

<p>Free sitters at the play always grumble most.</p>

<p>It is not the wine which makes a man drunk; it is the
man himself.</p>

<p>Better a dog in peace than a man in war.</p>

<p>Every one gives a shove to the tumbling wall.</p>

<p>Sweep the snow from your own doorstep.</p>

<p>He who rides a tiger cannot dismount.</p>

<p>Politeness before force.</p>

<p>One dog barks at something, and the rest bark at him.</p>

<p>You can’t clap hands with one palm.</p>

<p>Draw your bow, but don’t shoot.</p>

<p>One more good man on earth is better than an extra
angel in heaven.</p>

<p>Gold is tested by fire; man, by gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who have not tasted the bitterest of life’s bitters
can never appreciate the sweetest of life’s sweets.</p>

<p>Money makes a blind man see.</p>

<p>Man is God upon a small scale. God is man upon a
large scale.</p>

<p>A near neighbour is better than a distant relation.</p>

<p>Without error there could be no such thing as truth.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>


<p>What foreign students have achieved in the department of Chinese
literature from the sixteenth century down to quite recent times is
well exhibited in the three large volumes which form the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibliotheca
Sinica</cite>, or <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire Bibliographique des Ouvrages rélatifs à l’Empire
chinois</cite>, by Henri Cordier: Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1878; with
Supplément, 1895. This work is carried out with a fulness and accuracy
which leave nothing to be desired, and is essential to all systematic
workers in the Chinese field.</p>

<p>By far the most important of all books mentioned in the above
collection is a complete translation of the Confucian Canon by the
late Dr. James Legge of Aberdeen, under the general title of <cite>The
Chinese Classics</cite>. The publication of this work, which forms the
greatest existing monument of Anglo-Chinese scholarship, extended
from 1861 to 1885.</p>

<p>The <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cursus Literaturæ Sinicæ</cite>, by P. Zottoli, S.J., Shanghai, 1879-1882,
is an extensive series of translations into Latin from all branches
of Chinese literature, and is designed especially for the use of Roman
Catholic missionaries (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neo-missionariis accommodatus</i>).</p>

<p>Another very important work, now rapidly approaching completion,
is a translation by Professor E. Chavannes, Collège de France, of the
famous history described in Book II. chap, iii., under the title of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Mémoires Historiques de Se-ma Ts’ien</cite>, the first volume of which is
dated Paris, 1895.</p>

<p><cite>Notes on Chinese Literature</cite>, by A. Wylie, Shanghai, 1867, contains
descriptive notices of about 2000 separate Chinese works, arranged
under Classics, History, Philosophy, and Belles Lettres, as in the
Imperial Catalogue (see p. 387). Considering the date at which it
was written, this book is entitled to rank among the highest efforts of
the kind. It is still of the utmost value to the student, though in need
of careful revision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>The following Catalogues of Chinese libraries in Europe have been
published in recent years:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Catalogue of Chinese Printed Books, Manuscripts, and Drawings in
the Library of the British Museum.</cite> By R. K. Douglas, 1877.</p>

<p><cite>Catalogue of the Chinese Translation of the Buddhist Tripitaka.</cite>
By Bunyio Nanjio, 1883.</p>

<p><cite>Catalogue of the Chinese Books and Manuscripts in the Library of
Lord Crawford, Haigh Hall, Wigan.</cite> By J. P. Edmond, 1895.</p>

<p><cite>Catalogue of the Chinese and Manchu Books in the Library of the
University of Cambridge.</cite> By H. A. Giles, 1898.</p>

<p><cite>Catalogue des Livres Chinois, Coréens, Japonais, etc.</cite>, in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. By Maurice Courant, Paris, 1900. (Fasc. i. pp.
vii., 148, has already appeared.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The chief periodicals especially devoted to studies in Chinese literature
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>The Chinese Repository</cite>, published monthly at Canton from May
1832 to December 1851.</p>

<p><cite>The Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society</cite>,
published annually at Shanghai from 1858 to 1884, and since that
date issued in fascicules at irregular intervals during each year.</p>

<p><cite>The China Review</cite>, published every two months at Hong-Kong
from June 1872 to the present date.</p>

<p>There is also the <cite>Chinese Recorder</cite>, which has existed since 1868,
and is now published every two months at Shanghai. This is, strictly
speaking, a missionary journal, but it often contains valuable papers
on Chinese literature and cognate subjects.</p>

<p><cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Variétés Sinologiques</cite> is the title of a series of monographs on
various Chinese topics, written and published at irregular intervals by
the Jesuit Fathers at Shanghai since 1892, and distinguished by the
erudition and accuracy of all its contributors.</p>

Lancelot Giles, who went through the siege of Peking, writes as follows:&mdash;“An
attempt was made to save the famous <cite>Yung Lo Ta Tien</cite>, but heaps of
volumes had been destroyed, so the attempt was given up. I secured vol.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
